0,Affenpinscher,9-11.5 inches,7-10 pounds,12-15 years,3,3,3,3,3,1,Wiry,Short-Medium,5,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,148 of 202,Belge-Black-Black & Silver-Black & Tan-Red,Black Mask,"Loyal, curious, and famously amusing, this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it's the Affenpinscher's apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.
The Affen's apish look has been described many ways. They've been called 'monkey dogs' and 'ape terriers.' The French say diablotin moustachu ('mustached little devil'), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks.     Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. 'This isn't a breed you train, 'a professional dog handler tells us, 'He's like a human. You befriend him.' The dense, harsh coat is described as 'neat but shaggy' and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Affenpinschers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as luxating patella, heart anomalies, vision problems, and hip dysplasia. Like other shorter-faced breeds, Affens can experience breathing problems during hot weather if they are permitted to overheat and then have difficulty panting in order to lower their body temperature, as dogs don't sweat to keep cool.","The Affenpinscher's medium-length, wiry coat should be groomed twice a week, first with a brush and then with a metal comb. Any mats should be pulled apart with the fingers. The hair on the head is usually brushed forward over the face, and then an inverted V-shape is cut to expose the eyes. Similarly, the hair on the bridge of the nose is trimmed into a fan shape to keep the eyes clear. The Affen's coat does not grow quickly, so a trimming a pet Affen every few months should suffice. The breed's national parent club, the Affenpinscher Club of America, provides a detailed grooming guide. Affens should also have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.","One of the attractions of the toy breeds is that their small size makes them ideal apartment dogs. While Affenpinschers can be perfectly happy living in close quarters, the breed is classified as 'moderately active,' and as such, they do need exercise. Indoor play, both with his owner and just between himself and a toy, can be enough to make up a large chunk of an Affen's exercise regimen. Even so, a brisk walk once or twice a day is required. In addition to providing exercise, these walks give the Affen a chance to socialize both with people and other dogs.","Affenpinschers are courageous, bold, and often feisty. Basic obedience training is recommended. The breed has an undeserved reputation as being difficult to train because Affenpinschers are independent minded and can be stubborn. The key is that they are very intelligent and generally eager to please the humans they have bonded with. Keep in mind that they are easily bored and tend to lose interest during long training sessions. Shorter, more frequent sessions with a trainer who has experience working with toy breeds are usually quite successful."
1,Afghan-Hound,25-27 inches,50-60 pounds,12-18 years,3,3,3,1,4,1,Silky,Long,3,3,3,3,1,4,3,3,113 of 202,Black-Black & Silver-Black & Tan-Blue-Cream-Red-Silver-White-Blue & Cream,Black Mask-Brindle-Brindle Black Mask-Brindle Domino-Domino,"Among the most eye-catching of all dog breeds, the Afghan Hound is an aloof and dignified aristocrat of sublime beauty. Despite his regal appearance, the Afghan can exhibit an endearing streak of silliness and a profound loyalty.
Since ancient times, Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty. But the thick, silky, flowing coat that is the breed's crowning glory isn't just for show ' it served as protection from the harsh climate in mountainous regions where Afghans originally earned their keep. Beneath the Afghan's glamorous exterior is a powerful, agile hound ' standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder ' built for a long day's hunt. Their huge paw-pads acted as shock absorbers on their homeland's punishing terrain.  The Afghan Hound is a special breed for special people. A breed expert writes, 'It's not the breed for all would-be dog owners, but where the dog and owner combination is right, no animal can equal the Afghan Hound as a pet.'","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Sighthounds such as Afghans have naturally low stores of body fat, so they tend to be sensitive to anesthesia; breed experts recommend seeking out a sighthound-savvy veterinarian for surgical procedures. Like other deep-chested types of dogs, Afghan Hounds can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur.","Afghan puppies have short, fuzzy coats (including adorable facial hair called 'monkey whiskers') that require little maintenance. They don't stay that way for long, however. As is to be expected, the long, silky coat of an adolescent or adult Afghan requires regular grooming. Several hours per week of brushing are needed to keep the hair free of tangles and mats, as well as to remove any debris. Keeping the hair clean and mat-free is the key to keeping the Afghan's glorious coat looking its best. Regular bathing, with shampoo and conditioner, is also required. Like all breeds, Afghans should have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.","Because Afghans are sighthounds, bred to hunt and chase prey by sight, they will have a strong instinct to run off in pursuit of perceived prey; walking off leash is not advisable. Short walks do not provide enough exercise for this athletic breed, and some owners take their leashed Afghans on long runs once they reach maturity. Ideally, an Afghan should have the opportunity to run full out several times a week in a large, enclosed area. Afghans are tall, lean, and strong, which makes them excellent jumpers, so their exercise area must have a high, secure fence.","Afghans are independent, dignified, and aloof in general, but they are affectionate and extremely loyal to humans they have bonded with. This loyalty can make it difficult for an adult Afghan to adjust to a new home. On the other hand, it can make them fairly easy to housetrain, because they want to please their owners. Unless obedience or agility competition is a goal, teaching basic commands such as come, sit, and stay is generally sufficient. Afghan Hound owners are often quick to point out that no amount of training will overcome the breed's hunting instinct to break off on a high-speed chase."
2,Airedale-Terrier,23 inches,50-70 pounds,11-14 years,3,3,3,1,3,1,Wiry,Short-Medium,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,3,60 of 202,Black & Tan-Grizzle & Tan,,"His size, strength, and unflagging spirit have earned the Airedale Terrier the nickname 'The King of Terriers.' The Airedale stands among the world's most versatile dog breeds and has distinguished himself as hunter, athlete, and companion.
The Airedale Terrier is the largest of all terrier breeds. Males stand about 23 inches at the shoulder, females a little less. The dense, wiry coat is tan with black markings. Long, muscular legs give Airedales a regal lift in their bearing, and the long head'¿with its sporty beard and mustache, dark eyes, and neatly folded ears'¿conveys a keen intelligence. Airedales are the very picture of an alert and willing terrier'¿only bigger. And, like his smaller cousins in the terrier family, he can be bold, determined, and stubborn. Airedales are docile and patient with kids but won't back down when protecting hearth and home. Thanks to their famous do-it-all attitude, Airedales excel in all kinds of sports and family activities.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Airedales are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will test for health concerns such as hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joint. An Airedale's ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and his teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Airedale has a short, wiry coat that needs relatively little maintenance. Weekly brushing keeps the coat looking good and has the additional advantage of removing dead hair that would otherwise be shed around the house. (Some people with dog allergies have found that they can share a living space with a well-brushed Airedale without suffering any symptoms.) If the weekly session turns up any mats, they should be broken up with the fingers and then teased apart with a comb. Full grooming '¿ where the dog is bathed, brushed, and stripped or clipped '¿ should be done three or four times a year, either by the owner or a professional groomer.","Terriers are generally known for their high energy levels. Given that the Airedale is the largest of all terriers, that energy must be channeled into safe outlets. Fortunately, Airedales love to play with other family members. A daily play session of moderate length, in addition to walks (or backyard time) several times a day, should be enough to satisfy the Airedale's exercise requirements. Airedales play well with children, but interactions with toddlers and smaller children should be closely supervised. Airedales are rangy but strong; that strength, combined with a boisterous personality, can lead to mishaps.","Because of the Airedale's size (he is a medium-sized dog, but the largest of the terrier breeds), strength, and rambunctiousness, obedience training is highly recommended. At a minimum, an Airedale should learn basic obedience commands such as come, sit, and stay. The breed's intelligence and the fact that they bond closely with family members can make training easy. Owners and trainers should keep in mind that an intelligent dog is an easily bored dog, so varied training sessions will be more successful than repetitive ones. Also, an easily bored dog who is often left alone for long periods of time will tend to develop undesirable behaviors. It often helps to provide the dog with challenging toys that will keep him happily occupied."
3,Akita,26-28 inches (male),100-130 pounds (male),10-14 years,3,3,1,3,3,1,Double,Medium,2,3,5,3,3,4,2,3,47 of 202,"Black-Brown-Brown Brindle-Fawn-Fawn Brindle-Red-Red Brindle-Silver-White-Black Brindle-Silver Brindle-Brown, Black Overlay-Red, Black Overlay-Fawn, Black Overlay-Silver, Black Overlay-Black, Brown Undercoat-Black, Red Undercoat-Black, Silver Undercoat-Black, Fawn Undercoat-White, Red Shading","White Markings-Black Mask-White Mask-White Mask, White Markings-Black Mask, White Markings-Blk & White Mask White Mkngs-Pinto, Black & White Mask-Pinto, Black Mask-Pinto","Akita is muscular, double-coated dogs of ancient Japanese lineage famous for her dignity, courage, and loyalty. In her native land, she's venerated as family protectors and symbols of good health, happiness, and long life.
Akitas are burly, heavy-boned spitz-type dogs of imposing stature. Standing 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder, Akitas have a dense coat that comes in several colors, including white. The head is broad and massive, and is balanced in the rear by a full, curled-over tail. The erect ears and dark, shining eyes contribute to an expression of alertness, a hallmark of the breed.     Akitas are quiet, fastidious dogs. Wary of strangers and often intolerant of other animals, Akitas will gladly share their silly, affectionate side with family and friends. They thrive on human companionship. The large, independent-thinking Akita is hardwired for protecting those they love. They must be well socialized from birth with people and other dogs.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Like many dogs, Akitas can experience bloat, a sudden, life-threatening condition where the stomach can twist without veterinary intervention. Bloat is a medical emergency, and Akita owners should learn to recognize the signs. Prospective owners should be sure to work with a reputable breeder who tests his or her breeding stock for health concerns such as eye and thyroid disorders, and hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joints that can cause pain and arthritis.","Akitas tend to be clean and have little 'doggy odor.' They don't require extensive grooming, but their thick, luxurious double coat should be brushed at least once a week to look its best. Although Akitas shed only minimally most of the time, expect their dense undercoat to 'blow' twice a year, where it will shed so profusely that it comes out in clumps all over your house. During this time it helps to brush the dog more frequently to get rid of the dead coat. The nails should also be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause pain and problems for the dog. Remember also to brush the dog's teeth often to ensure dental health.","The Akita is generally not a highly active breed but does require moderate exercise. A jog or brisk walk around the block at least once a day can meet the needs of most individuals of the breed. Akitas also enjoy playing energetically. Although they are large dogs '¿ males often weigh more than 100 pounds '¿ with sufficient daily exercise Akitas can do well in a relatively small home. They are hardy dogs bred to withstand the harsh outdoor conditions of northern Japan, but they were bred as housedogs and guardians as well as hunters, and adapt very well to life in the home.","Akitas are very intelligent and loyal but also have an independent, headstrong nature. As large and very powerful dogs, it is vital that they are trained consistently,  beginning in puppyhood. They are instinctive guardians, so it's especially important that Akitas have early and extensive socialization when young. They must learn to accept a wide variety of strangers and not perceive them as a threat. Because of their independence and strong prey drive, they should never be off lead in an unsecured area. Akitas tend to be aggressive toward other dogs, particularly of the same sex, and extreme caution should be used in canine interactions."

They come in three different sizes.
The Alaskan Klee Kai is a small sized companion dog with a smooth, agile, and well-balanced gait, a body that is well proportioned in three size varieties: toy, miniature, and standard; with a level topline and a length slightly longer than height.  The wedge-shaped head, erect triangle shaped ears, well furred double coat in three symmetrical contrasting color varieties, and a loosely curled tail reflect its arctic heritage.

","The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is a generally healthy breed.  Responsible breeders screen breeding stock for health conditions including patellar luxation, autoimmune thyroiditis, heart murmur, eye disorders, and Factor VII deficiency.  Prospective AKK owners are  encouraged to purchase from responsible/reputable breeders who are doing these  evaluations, and confirm the health screening of the sire and dam.  Responsible breeders use the many tools available, along with the knowledge of their dogs¿ pedigrees, to  selectively choose breeding dogs in order to reduce the likelihood of temperament,  structure and health concerns.    ","The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is a double coated breed, with a short dense undercoat and a longer outer coat of guard hairs. This coat not only helps insulate them from the cold and heat, it also helps protect the skin from the sun. While the undercoat is shed (or blown) twice a year, some owners quip that it lasts for six months at a time. Weekly brushings and/or combing help keep the coat and skin in good condition, and help reduce the hair around the house.  AKK often need only a few baths a year as their coats tend to naturally repel dirt, and they do not have the ¿dog odor¿ that many breeds have. Blowing the dog with a strong cool blow-dryer is also a good way to remove loose hair and dirt. Avoid using any tools with blades. The nails should be trimmed regularly to prevent any foot problems.  Alaskan Klee Kai competing in conformation require a bit more selective grooming or bathing for the best presentation. The breed standard is specific: ""The Alaskan Klee Kai is shown in its natural state and the only trimming permissible is around the foot area to present a clean/neat appearance. Any trimming of the whiskers, or the fur on any other part of the dog, is to be severely penalized.""","The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is an active dog with a medium-high energy level. Regular exercise and doing activities together, both physically and mentally, strengthens the bond between dog and owner, and helps to avoid potential destructive behavior. AKK enjoy doing performance sports or exploring life with their people in many activities such as camping, hiking, climbing, swimming, boating, kayaking, and even on paddle boards! For those who live in a more urban setting, or have a more sedate lifestyle, daily walks or a game of fetch can also provide great exercise. Alaskan Klee Kai are foremost loving companion dogs who form strong bonds with their family and are as happy playfully interacting with their owners exploring the outdoors as they are relaxing lovingly on the laps of their youthful or elderly owners. Like many dog breeds, Alaskan Klee Kai are curious, clever, fast and sneaky, and may have a high prey drive, so it is important to keep the dog on a leash or in a securely fenced yard (or secured area) at all times when outside of the home. AKK are not suitable for people who cannot spend time with their dogs","The Alaskan Klee Kai are a perceptive breed that enjoys being physically and mentally challenged. They love learning new things, and have an energetic eagerness to participate in a broad array of activities which make them well suited for multiple performance sports such as Agility, Racing, Obedience, Rally, Scent Work, Weight Pull, Dock Diving, and Carting. They are also used in therapy work, service work, diabetic and gluten detection, as well as emotional support dogs. AKK have a sensitive, reserved and cautious nature.

The Alaskan Malamute stands 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds. Everything about Mals suggests their origin as an arctic sled dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and dense, weatherproof coat all scream, 'I work hard for a living!' But their almond-shaped brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans when the workday is done. Mals are pack animals. And in your family 'pack,' the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn't respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other way around. Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a well-behaved Mal is a joy to be with'¿playful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","A responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia (a malformation of the hip joint that is the most common skeletal condition in dogs), elbow dysplasia, thrombopathia, chondrodysplasia ('dwarfism'), hypothyroidism, inherited polyneuropathy, von Willebrand's disease, and day blindness. As with all breeds, an Alaskan Malamute's ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and his teeth should be brushed regularly.","The thick, waterproof double coat of the Alaskan Malamute is beautifully adapted to harsh Arctic life, but it requires constant upkeep. A Malamute should be brushed every day with a pin brush and metal comb, all the while checking for mats, which can harbor fungus, and hot spots, which can become infected. Twice a year, during shedding season, an undercoat rake should be added to the regimen. Show Malamutes are often bathed weekly, but a pet Malamute can go six to eight weeks between baths.  Conditioner can be used, in moderation, if the coat feels dry. As with all breeds, the Malamute's nails should be trimmed regularly.","While the Malamute was not bred for racing, he was bred to work. A strong, athletic dog with tremendous endurance, designed to carry heavy loads, a Mal requires daily exercise. Romping in a well-fenced yard or other enclosed space will suffice, but Malamutes also enjoy hiking, running, and swimming with their owners. And should the owner have sufficient time and interest, Malamutes often take part in agility and obedience trials, weight-pulling competitions, backpacking (yes, you can buy a backpack for your dog), recreational or competitive sledding, and skijoring (pulling a person who is on skis).","Socialization and obedience training are necessary in order to prevent a Malamute from becoming pushy with children and other pets, or dominant over adults he or she doesn't respect. Malamutes are highly intelligent but also independent and willful, often to the point of stubbornness. While fairness and patience can yield a devoted, trustworthy companion, there are certain behaviors that may be impossible to train out of a Mal, such as digging, so any yard fencing must continue into the ground. And Malamutes are not especially suited to be guard dogs because they tend to be friendly with everyone they meet."

Historically, they were bred to be a utility dog used for working the farm.
The American Bulldog is a descendant of the English Bulldog. It is believed that the bulldog was in America as early as the 17th century. They came to the United States in the 1800s, with immigrants who brought their working bulldogs with them. Small farmers and ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock dogs, and catch dogs. The breed largely survived, particularly in the southern states, due to its ability to bring down and catch feral pigs.

The breed we know as the American Bulldog was originally known by many different names before the name American Bulldog became the standard. In different parts of the South he was known as the White English Southern Bulldog, but most commonly just ""bulldog."" The breed was not called a bulldog because of a certain look, but because they did real bulldog work.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The American Bulldog is considered a healthy breed. Owners should maintain a schedule of examinations and vaccinations as recommended by their veterinarian. Hip and joint problems are a concern for this breed, hip and elbow evaluations should also be done. Just like other breeds, the American Bulldog has the potential to develop genetic health problems. Breeders should pre-screen any potential breeding pairs for genetic diseases.","Grooming your American Bulldog can be a pretty easy task. This breed does not need to be bathed often, only occasional baths when they become dirty. Regular brushing will help keep their coat clean and shiny. Their nails should be trimmed every few weeks and ears should be cleaned once a month or as needed. Their teeth should be brushed regularly. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.","The American Bulldog is an athlete. For puppies, owners will need to practice non-impact exercises to decrease possible bone and joint damage. As adults, the American Bulldog will need a range of activities from jogs, hikes, tug-a-war games, to training exercises. The breed does not do well being left alone in a back yard. As this may lead to a variety of behavior problems related to pent-up energy. This breed requires frequent exercise and constant stimulation. Developing his athletic abilities will help this breed stay fit and happy.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital in channeling the American Bulldog's energy. Rules and routines should be put in place early and adhered to as dogs grow up. They require a firm but loving hand to establish and retain proper boundaries. The more exposure to good training practices, other dogs, and people, the more likely the success at being managed both inside and outside of their environment."

The sight of the American English Coonhound tearing through the moonlit woods, all sinew and determination, bawling their lusty night music, is coon-hunter heaven.
Standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder, American English Coonhounds are deep-chested, sweet-faced athletes beloved by sportsmen for their speed and endurance. Stretched tightly across the athletic frame is a medium-length coat of various patterns, some with ticking. The head is broad with a domed skull, with soft, low-hung ears and dark-brown eyes that glow with warmth and kindness.



 American English Coonhounds are mellow when off duty but tenacious and stubborn in pursuit of their ring-tailed prey. Their work drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for things other than coon hunting, and their loud, ringing bark can make the breed a bad fit as house pets for novice owners. Some passionate fans of American English Coonhounds feel that without a sporting outlet for this breed's houndy virtues, you're simply wasting a good dog.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Still bred primarily as a hard-working dog, which must have an efficient physical condition, the American English Coonhound is generally a healthy breed. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia as well as eye disorders such as progressive retinal atrophy and cataracts. His ears should be checked regularly to remove excess wax and debris. Like other large and deep-chested breeds, he can experience bloat, a sudden, life-threatening stomach condition. Owners should learn the signs of bloat and what to do should it occur.","Good nutrition influences the shine and texture of your American English Coonhound's coat from the inside, but he will still need regular grooming to be at his best. His short, hard, protective coat requires a minimum of care. Using a shedding tool or a grooming mitt with rubber nubs at least weekly will help to keep his shedding to a minimum. This also distributes skin oils down the hair shaft, giving his coat a natural shine. His nails should be trimmed once a month, and a bath every four to six weeks will keep the coat and skin clean and healthy, and reduce doggy odor. His ears should be checked weekly and gently cleaned of any excess wax or debris.","With his high energy level and innate desire to be part of a pack, whether human or canine, the American English is an ideal candidate as a companion for someone who is an active runner, biker, or hiker. He needs a lot of exercise to stay healthy and happy. The breed has a very strong prey drive, so should never be allowed off leash in an uncontrolled situation, as he will not be able to resist the instinct to follow an interesting scent he detects with his sensitive nose. He requires a fenced area where he can run freely. Chasing a ball in his backyard can be an excellent source of exercise.","Following through with proper early socialization of your American English Coonhound is paramount, or your puppy may become possessive over food or toys in your home. The key to a well-adjusted, mentally healthy dog is to have him experience positive interactions with many different kinds of people in a variety of places and situations. Like many hounds, English dogs have a split personality: tenacious, tireless, and stubborn on the trail, but at home these spirited hunters are sweetly amiable companions. Still, the breed's limitless prey drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for anything other than coon hunting, and their tendency to bark in a loud, ringing voice make them most appropriate for experienced dog owners."

However, Eskies shed almost constantly. A thorough brushing two or three times a week will remove dead hairs before they can be shed, as well as help to prevent matting. The oil on an Eskie's fur prevents dirt from adhering, so a good brushing is usually enough to remove it. It is OK to bathe  an Eskie occasionally, but doing so more than once every few months can make his skin dry and irritated. As with all breeds, the Eskie's nails should be trimmed regularly.","An active dog with lots of energy, the Eskie is also quick and curious, requiring lots of exercise and mental challenges. An Eskie who is left alone or who doesn't get enough exercise can quickly become destructive. A securely fenced yard and an assortment of toys will help provide good exercise and stimulation to keep an Eskie out of trouble. He shouldn't just be left out in the yard by himself all day, however. Despite his warm coat, the Eskie is an indoor dog, and he forms strong bonds with his people and is happiest interacting with them. Once they pass middle age, Eskies often become more sedate.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Fortunately, the American Eskimo Dog is among the most trainable of all breeds. Back when traveling circuses, vaudeville troupes, and Wild West shows crisscrossed the map, Eskies were mainstays of trained-dog acts. They are highly intelligent and eager to please. They learn new commands quickly '¿ sometimes just by watching other dogs. An Eskie craves companionship and interaction with his owners and will tend to develop problem behaviors if left alone too often for long periods of time."

They are closely associated with Revolutionary heroes and the rolling estates of old Virginia.
American Foxhounds are sleek, rangy hunters known for their speed, endurance, and work ethic. You can tell the American Foxhound apart from their British cousin the English Foxhound by length of leg'¿the American's legs are longer and more finely boned'¿and by the American's slightly arched loin (back end). American Foxhounds have large, soft eyes with an expression described as gentle and pleading.



 So far, so good. But Foxhounds come with special considerations. They need lots of exercise or they can get depressed and destructive. A Foxhound's single-minded prey drive must be managed. Their loud bawling is melodious to hound lovers but can be a nuisance to neighbors, and training and housebreaking these independent souls can be a steep challenge for novice owners.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The American Foxhound is typically a healthy breed, and a responsible breeder will test breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia and thrombocytopathy, which is a blood disorder. Long-eared breeds can develop ear infections, and a Foxhound's ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax. Regular brushing will keep the hound's teeth healthy as well.","The American Foxhound's handsome coat is short and lies close to the body. The coat's hard texture protects the dog from the underbrush he courses through while on the hunt'¿and the coat also happens to be extremely easy to take care of. A short, once-a-week session with a bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove is usually all that is needed. The Foxhound should not need to be bathed unless he gets into something particularly messy while outdoors. As with all breeds, the American Foxhound'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly.","Foxhounds were bred specifically to spend long hours chasing after prey. That's why an American Foxhound needs at least a solid hour or two of exercise every day'¿if he doesn't get it, he may become bored and destructive. If they get all the activity they need, they can fit in pretty much anywhere. While they are happiest living indoors with their human family, American Foxhounds make great companions on long walks or hikes. Because they were bred to hunt and chase animals and to follow a scent, they should only be allowed loose in areas that are securely fenced, and any walks must be taken on a leash. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in canine sports such as tracking, rally, coursing ability tests, and other activities that can be enjoyed together by dog and owner.","American Foxhounds are easygoing and amiable. They also can be stubborn and independent, however, which can make training an exercise in patience. Obedience classes are recommended, and as scenthounds, it may never be safe to have them off-leash, because their noses can lead them into trouble. Foxhounds raised in the home tend to be wonderfully mild-tempered, devoted, and easygoing companions, and they get along well with children. Even so, owners will need patience and persistence when training them, and hounds can develop unwanted behaviors if not given enough exercise."

He is a fine choice for allergy sufferers who want a dog with true terrier grit and courage.
The American Hairless Terrier stands between 12 to 16 inches at the shoulder, and comes in both coated and hairless varieties. The hairless variety might have eyebrows and whiskers, while the coated has a short, shiny coat. The skin of the hairless is smooth and warm to the touch. The broad, wedge-shaped head is a hallmark of both varieties. Erect, V-shaped ears frame the round, expressive eyes that gleam with curiosity.
 
 The American Hairless moves with jaunty pep in his step that announces real terrier attitude. The hairless variety is as hypoallergenic as a dog can get. Hairlessness, though, presents its own challenges. Sunburn is a concern, and cold weather requires special precautions. This breed is protective of their humans and make alert watchdogs.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","Responsible breeders screen for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, cardiac conditions, luxating patella (a dislocated kneecap similar to what is called a 'trick knee' in humans), and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, a hip condition that can be corrected with surgery. Skin problems are quite rare in the breed. As with all breeds, an American Hairless Terrier's ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and the teeth should be brushed regularly.","The American Hairless Terrier actually comes in two varieties: coated and hairless. For either type, grooming needs are minimal. For the hairless variety, there is little maintenance involved other than keeping the ears clean and making sure the dog is protected from sunburn. The variety with a short, shiny coat is almost as carefree. They hardly shed, so all that's called for is a quick session with a soft bristle brush once a week, and an occasional bath as needed. As with all breeds, the American Hairless Terrier'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly.","The American Hairless Terrier has only moderate exercise needs. They have to go outside several times a day, of course, but brief daily sessions in a fenced-in yard or on regular walks will generally be all they require. They enjoy activity but are also quite happy to curl up on the couch next to their owner. The breed is friendly and happy to play with people or other dogs. Thanks to their high trainability, they can do well in a wide range of canine activities such as obedience, rally, and agility competitions.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of about 7 weeks and 4 months will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Puppy training classes help owners learn how to recognize and avert any behavior problems and enhance the bond between the puppy and owner. The American Hairless Terrier is very intelligent and eager to please, so training is usually an easy and enjoyable activity."

American Leopards are one of the oldest tree dog breeds in the U.S. and have extremely strong tracking abilities, often able to track prey for miles.
The American Leopard Hound is a medium to large size dog and comes in three patterns: Solid, Leopard and Brindle; nine different official colors; and a variety of markings, however, sixty percent of all American Leopards are solid-colored dogs. The breed is very versatile in hunting a variety of game species including, but not limited to, raccoon, bear, bobcat, cougar, squirrel, and any other tree-minded game. As an especially tough breed, they also fare exceptionally well in extreme weather, both hot and cold.

","Most American Leopard Hounds are healthy dogs. Prospective American Leopard Hound owners should work with a responsible breeder, who can educate them about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize genetic testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies. The mating of two merle-colored American Leopards creates the possibility of puppies called double merles. These pups carry a much higher risk of being blind, deaf, or sight or hearing-impaired.","Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. American Leopard Hounds have a smooth, dense, double coat; the outer coat is rough and the undercoat is fine and wooly. Beyond regular weekly brushing, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Their strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","American Leopard Hounds are an energetic breed. Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise. As a hunting breed with energy to spare, American Leopards would do best as part of an active, rural family.","American Leopard Hounds are eager to please and, therefore, easy to train.

Their courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well-socialized AmStaff is a loyal, trustworthy friend to the end.
AmStaffs are stocky, muscular bull-type terriers standing 17 to 19 inches at the shoulder. The head is broad, the jaws well defined, the cheekbones pronounced, and the dark, round eyes are set wide apart. AmStaff movement is agile and graceful, with a springy gait that advertises the breed's innate confidence. The stiff, glossy coat comes in many colors and patterns. AmStaffers describe their dogs as keenly aware of their surroundings, game for anything, and lovable 'personality dogs' around the house. AmStaffs like mental and physical challenges. They are highly trainable, as their many forays into showbiz suggest. When acquiring an AmStaff, there's only one way to go: Do your homework and find a responsible AKC breeder.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Am Staff is a robust, healthy breed, and a responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for these health conditions such as canine hip dysplasia, cardiac disease, and skin and coat allergies. A genetic test has recently been developed for cerebellar ataxia, which causes a progressive decline in muscle coordination, first appearing between ages 3 and 5 years; now, by identifying dogs with the mutation, breeders can avoid producing it in their bloodlines. As with all breeds, the ears should be checked regularly, and the dog's teeth should be brushed often.","Taking care of the AmStaff's short, stiff coat is remarkably easy. A quick once-over with a soft bristle brush every week is usually enough to remove any dirt or other foreign matter. What's more, a good brushing distributes skin oils throughout the coat to help keep it healthy. If an Am Staff gets into something particularly messy, a bath will probably be called for. Otherwise, bathing can wait until when and if he develops a 'doggy' smell. As with all breeds, the AmStaff'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful and cause the dog problems while walking and running.","An athletic, energetic dog such as the American Staffordshire Terrier requires a lot of exercise. Leaving the dog out in the yard all day is not the right approach, however: Yes, he can run around, but the AmStaff is a people-oriented dog who thrives when he is made part of the family. Long play sessions with his owner develop his physical and psychological health. In addition, many AmStaffs enjoy taking part in canine sports such as obedience, agility, and dock diving. AmStaffs are even trained in search-and-rescue and excel at it.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all breeds, but given the AmStaff's strong will, physical strength, and exuberance, they are a necessity. The breed's intelligence and desire to please make training a fun, easy process. Even so, certain behaviors, such as chewing and digging, may be hard to resolve. It must be noted that dog aggression can develop even in well-socialized Am Staffs; an AmStaff should never under any circumstances be left alone with other dogs."

American Water Spaniels are muscular midsize gundogs, not flashy in looks or performance, and recognizable by a luscious brown coat that is either tightly curled or wavy. Bred to work the icy waters and marshy banks of the Great Lakes region, these spaniels are ideally outfitted for the job: The coat is dense and waterproof, the feet are thickly padded, the toes are webbed, and the body is small enough for the dog to hop in and out of a skiff without rocking the boat. The breed's admirers describe a merry, intelligent, and versatile spaniel suited to a variety of dog sports. As hunters, they combine the working traits of spaniels and retrievers. The key to the American Water Spaniel's happiness is activity, especially alongside their adored human.

During the summer, the coat is sparser, and can be brought into shape with a rubber-tipped pin brush. The rest of the year, and especially during shedding season, a slicker brush should be used to remove the dead hair from the undercoat. As with all breeds, the American Water Spaniel'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly.","American Water Spaniels are outdoorsy athletes who love hunting and swimming, so they need ample exercise. Without sufficient activity, they can become barky and destructive. At a minimum, vigorous play sessions with their owner or a companion dog in a park or a large backyard are needed every day. They truly thrive, however, when given a job to do and make great hunting companions'¿after all, it's in their DNA. Participating in field trials or obedience, agility, or dock diving events will give the American Water Spaniel a chance to burn off all that excess energy in a positive way.","As with all breeds, early socialization puppy training classes are highly recommended.

The Anatolian Shepherd Dog stands between 27 and 29 inches at the shoulder and can weigh as much as 150 pounds. Profusely muscled but nimble afoot, Anatolians are more than a match for the predators and harsh terrain of their homeland. Anatolians descend from some of the oldest known domestic-canine bloodlines. This lends the breed a sense of timelessness, a no-frills, untouched quality that takes us back 6,000 years to the Bronze Age.



 Anatolians are smart, devoted, responsive, and adaptable. They will protect their flock'¿livestock, children, smaller dogs, even the family cat'¿with intensity. Anatolian owners must be strong leaders, willing and able to handle a dog as dominating and demanding as he is calm and loving.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Anatolian is overall a healthy and hardy breed. Hip dysplasia is not common in Anatolians, nor is bloat, a life-threatening twisting and inversion of the stomach. Owners should know the symptoms of bloat, however, so as to act quickly should it occur. The breed can be sensitive to anesthesia, and owners should ensure that their vet is aware of this before any procedures. Good breeders will screen for entropion, in which the eyelids invert, which can be surgically corrected. An Anatolian's ears should be checked regularly for any signs of infection, and the dog's teeth should be brushed frequently.","Bred to work outdoors, the Anatolian has a thick undercoat that protects him from the elements. Some Anatolians have a long outer coat, but on most it is quite short, and a quick brushing once a week will keep it looking good. Keep in mind, though, that the Anatolian sheds  his undercoat twice a year. During shedding season, he will need to given a thorough brushing-out to remove the dead hair, with a short-bristle brush and possibly a comb as well, every few days. As with all breeds, the Anatolian's nails should be trimmed regularly.","Because he only needs a moderate amount of exercise, an Anatolian will be happy with time in a yard'¿be sure it has a tall, strong fence and a locked gate'¿and a long walk once or twice a day. Remember, though, that an Anatolian must be kept on leash whenever he is taken out of the home. As one breeder says, ""Don't assume that your dogs will be reliable off leash. False security on your part can become a disaster.'","Because the breed tends to be wary toward others and instinctively protective, an Anatolian puppy must be socialized. Obedience training is a must with the breed. The Anatolian was bred to work independently, make decisions on his own, and protect his flock from outsiders, and training the breed to respond to commands can be a challenge. Under no circumstances should an Anatolian receive protection or guard-dog training."

They are highly intelligent and need a job to do. Early socialization is necessary, and training at an early age is crucial. They are a strong powerful breed with incredible speed and need plenty of room to run. This is not a breed that thrives in a busy urban environment or in the suburbs unless he has lots of activity, nor is it a breed for kenneling. He prefers to be outside, where his strong herding and guarding instincts and his bond with his territory and his 'people' keep him from running off.","The Appenzeller is a high-spirited dog that is very capable and reliable. Early socialization and puppy obedience are absolutely crucial. They are highly intelligent and need a fair but firm 'leader.' The Appenzeller does not react well to harsh or hard handling, but the owner/trainer must be firm, respectful, and most of all, consistent in their training. This breed is watchful and protective of his territory, home and people. It is very important to socialize the Appenzeller with people, dogs, and other animals early on, and expose him to a variety of surroundings and situations.

Both coat varieties feature distinctive mottling or specking patterns. ACDs have immense work drive and excel at hunting, chasing, and, of course, moving livestock. Their boundless energy and supple gait make them excellent running partners.

 ACDs are true-blue loyal, famously smart, ever alert, and wary of strangers. If an ACD isn't challenged, he easily becomes bored and gets into mischief.

 ","Australian Kelpies need a lot of exercise to be their happiest selves. A good jog or long workout combined with the mental exercise of obedience lessons should be done daily. Kelpies prefer to have a job to do (they will try to herd other dogs, pets, even children), but they also have an 'off' switch. They can do a five-mile run, then settle on the couch with the family to watch a movie.

Aussies often work and/or play outdoors, so it's not unusual for them to come in dirtier than they left. But unless they've gotten into a particularly messy situation, they require a bath only occasionally. As with all breeds, the Aussie'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly.","A high-energy, athletic dog, the Aussie needs a great deal of exercise on a daily basis. At minimum, he should have a large, fenced-in yard to run around in for at least an hour or two daily. Aussies bond closely with their owners and love to accompany them on long walks'¿or, better yet, hikes. Once an Aussie leaves puppyhood behind, and his skeletal system is fully formed, he can make a great running companion. The best course, however, is to give the Aussie a job, whether that is herding livestock, shepherding children, or competing in canine events such as obedience, herding or agility trials, or dock diving.","Early socialization and obedience training are both musts for the Australian Shepherd. One of the most frequent reasons Aussies end up in rescue situations is owners couldn't (or wouldn't) constructively channel the breed's boundless energy through training. Aussies bond strongly to their families and so can be territorial and overprotective of their owners' property, and they can become destructive if left without companionship for long periods too often. Fortunately, that loyalty combined with the breed's keen intelligence and high energy makes them very easy to train."

Upbeat and lively, the self-assured Aussie approaches life with plenty of the old-time terrier curiosity and grit.
Australian Terriers are small but sturdy, self-confident terriers known for a longish torso, distinctive coat furnishings around the neck and forequarters, and a topknot of soft, silky hair that contrasts in texture with an otherwise harsh coat. A long neck lends a dash of elegance to this rough-and-ready terrier, and the dark eyes sparkle with a keen intelligence. Coat colors are blue-and-tan, or solid red or sandy. Aussies move with the free and easy gait of a working dog. They are alert watchdogs and said to be quick studies when training. True terriers, Aussies love digging, and the urge to chase small, furry critters has never left them. Not always a great fit in multi-dog households, Aussies want you all to themselves.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","In general, the Aussie is a sturdy breed with few health problems. A responsible breeder will test breeding stock for health conditions such as luxating patella (a dislocated kneecap called a 'trick knee' in humans) and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, a malformation of the hip joint that manifests early and can be corrected with surgery. Some dogs can develop itchy skin conditions, and flea control is essential. As with all breeds, the ears should be checked regularly, and the teeth should be brushed often.","The Australian Terrier's harsh, weatherproof, double coat does a good job of repelling dirt and mud, and is very easy to maintain. A quick brushing once a week is usually enough to keep it in fine shape. The long hairs that grow in front of and between the eyes can irritate the eyes if left unchecked; fortunately, they are easily plucked out with tweezers or fingers. An Aussie should have a bath only when needed. Shampooing softens the harsh coat, rendering its dirt-shedding capability ineffective, and too much bathing can also make the Aussie's skin dry and flaky. As with all breeds, the Aussie'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly.","Terriers in general have a high energy level, and the Aussie is no exception. The breed is very active and requires regular exercise to keep from becoming bored and unhappy. Boredom leads to undesirable behavior. Daily play sessions, indoors or out, will keep an Aussie happy and well adjusted. However, these sessions must take place is a securely fenced yard, and when on walks or hikes, an Aussie must be on a leash. Aussies should never run loose'¿their instinct to hunt is very strong, and they might not be able to resist running off to chase a cat or squirrel, and might pursue their prey so far from home that they can't find their way back.","Aussies, like many terriers, benefit greatly from  puppy training classes and introductory obedience with treats, toys, or praise. Aussies are easily bored with routine, so training sessions will be short, whether the owner wants them to be or not. They are also willful and stubborn, so a firm, consistent approach is necessary. Even with training, though, an Aussie can be reluctant to share toys or human attention, and two males may not be able to share a household."

The Azawakh has a short, fine coat which may come in any color or color combinations: red, clear sand to fawn, brindled, parti-color (which may be predominantly white), blue, black and brown. The head may have a black mask and there may be white markings on the legs, bib and at the tip of tail. There are no color or marking disqualifications in the breed. Befitting its heritage, the Azawakh excels as a companion, guardian and a lure courser in the United States.
This ancient hunting hound is so lean and rangy that his bone structure and musculature can plainly be seen beneath his skin. The smooth S-shaped contours, deep chest, and aerodynamic head mark the Azwakh as a member of the sighthound family, canine sprinters that rely on keen vision and blazing speed to fix and course their prey. The ultrafine coat comes in several colors and patterns. The overall look of this leggy hound is one of elegance and fineness, but don't be fooled: This is a tough, durable hunter who's been chasing gazelle across the scorching sands of the Sahara for more than a thousand years.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","Azawakhs are generally health dogs, and a responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health issues such as hypothyroidism, seizures, cardiac problems, and autoimmune-mediated disease. Azawakhs are slender, elegant dogs whose thin skin naturally allows their bone structure and muscle to show through; owners should learn what an Azawakh in good weight and condition looks like.","The Azawakh's short, fine coat requires minimal upkeep. A weekly once-over with a soft bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove is usually all that's needed to keep the coat in good condition. Azawakhs don't have a doggy odor, so frequent bathing isn't necessary. Even if the hound does find his way into a mud puddle, a bath may not be required'¿waiting for the mud to dry and then brushing it away may do the trick. As with all breeds, the Azawakh's nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails are painful and can impede the dog's gait.","The Azawakh is an active breed, requiring daily exercise to keep both mind and body healthy. Adult Azawakhs can make great running companions. Failing that, a daily half-hour play session in a well-fenced field, park, or yard will keep the hound happy and healthy. However, an Azawakh left alone in the yard will not self-exercise. He is more likely to get the activity he needs in the presence of the owner or another dog.","Because the Azawakh is both highly intelligent and fiercely independent, training needs to be started early. Early socialization and puppy training classes with a trainer who has a positive approach are recommended. The Azawakh possesses an amazing amount of dignity and does not respond well to harsh or punishment-based training, which can produce a hound who is either broken in spirit, or aggressive and unmanageable. Positive, reward-based training with gentle but firm corrections can result in a hound who is obedient, affectionate, and loyal."

 ","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
",The Barbado   da Terceira has a propensity for Hip Dysplasia.,"The Barbado da Terceira should be bathed only on an ¿as-needed¿ basis.  If brushed well, they will not need to be bathed often as bathing strips the dog of valuable skin oils.  A bath every two months should therefore be adequate. Puppy hair needs to be brushed regularly. One must especially watch for tangles between the toes and clipped if found. Hair that grows too long over the eyes should also be trimmed. When the adult coat starts to grow, and the puppy hair falls out, loose hairs often get stuck in the new coat and can cause tangles, especially in the neck. These are difficult to remove, especially if the real coat   gets  longer. Hair should be brushed well down to the skin, working from the legs upwards. If this is too difficult, they should be shaved  to 1-1 ½   inches (7F clipper). Because the Barbado does not shed, hair should be trimmed when it gets too long. Trimming summer is not needed as the undercoat takes care of the heat. They need to be brushed at least weekly to ensure that hair is not matted and that twigs and burrs are removed. Their nails should be checked every few weeks and trimmed as needed. Many have back dew claws that need to be trimmed. Removal is not recommended. Ears should be checked once a week and cleaned as needed. Hair inside the ear may be removed with ear powder but should not be cut. Their teeth should be brushed regularly.","Daily exercise is crucial. These dogs are so smart that they must be mentally, as well as physically, stimulated. They do not need a fenced- in yard, preferring to stay close to home and to their people. They are territorial of their home and yard so must be supervised if neighborhood dogs live nearby. Barbado da Terceira's are happiest when they have a cow to herd, but if these are not available, a ball will do.  They will willingly walk, hike, or jog with their human. Agility courses and herding courses, if available, are also great substitutes for those not living on a farm. Owners whose flowers are eaten by deer will be in awe of the agility with which the Barbado da Terceira herds them - away - from their homes. Barbado da Terceira's will be giddy and vocal when playing with each   other.  Other breeds may be initially confused by the BTD¿s earnest play but they quickly become accustomed to it.","The Barbado da Terceira is an assertive breed.  She needs firm, consistent, and loving   training from an early age. Instincts don¿t simply go away. The herding   instinct is a prey instinct that has been contained through selective breeding and training. Herding dogs may often nip at their people¿s  (especially children) heels in an effort to ¿herd¿ them. Sometimes this over-stimulation of instinctual behaviors, if not dealt with, leads to incorrigible behavior that will be increasingly difficult to turn around.  She needs firm, consistent, and loving training from an early age. Barbado da Terceiras are cattle herders and not a protection breed. They will protect their people though. Since herding breeds exist to keep their flocks safe from predators; their vision and hearing is superb.  They may vocalize at any visual change in their environment or any sounds with which they are unfamiliar. Due to the Barbado da Terceira¿s beauty, intelligence, and joyful nature, they are increasingly popular family pets on the mainland of Portugal,  throughout Europe and in the U.S.A., however, they need to be physically and mentally active to be successful pets. They are good with children, but should be supervised. They are also good with other dogs, but must be supervised if with an unfamiliar dog. Dominant Barbado da Terceiras may fight other dogs so early socialization with many dogs is key. The  Barbado da Terceira is recommended for those with some or much experienced dog owners. Positive reinforcement should be used.  When this is not enough, they may have to have a ¿time out¿ to become calm again. The  Barbado da Terceira is a sensitive dog that is quite willing to please and harsh punishment may result in the opposite of what is intended.  If treated harshly, the Barbado da Terceira may become anxious or frightened, which can lead to long-term behavioral issues such as aggression. New owners who consider sending their puppies to overnight training centers must recognize the potential long-term consequences of such training. While the training might ¿correct¿ unwanted behaviors in the short term, there is no guarantee that the puppy will not be traumatized, leading to more undesirable behaviors in the long term.  This is true even of training centers that come with the best recommendations and that promise that they will only use positive reinforcement. Puppies are not one-size-fits-all and your trainer will not be familiar with the needs of your  Barbado da Terceira puppy, regardless of his/her assertions of familiarity with all dogs. The new puppy must bond with its owners; sending him/her away will lead to   depression and feelings of abandonment and will most likely break bonds that have already been formed.  There is no replacement for firm, consistent, but loving training by their human begins in the first moment that a new puppy is brought home."

In profile, the Barbet is slightly rectangular with a substantial head and long, sweeping tail. He has a long, dense covering of curly hair and a distinctive beard. An agile athlete, the Barbet has been used primarily to locate, flush, and retrieve birds. He has a cheerful disposition and is very social and loyal.
The defining characteristic of this rustic, medium-sized bird dog is the dense curly coat that covers him from the top of his large, broad head to the tip of his curving tail. The coat comes in shades of black, gray, brown, or fawn, sometimes with white markings. The breed's delightfully shaggy coat and amiable nature creates the impression of a Muppet come to life, but the Barbet is a strong, solidly-built dog bred for centuries to be a keen hunter and tireless swimmer. Barbets are very intelligent and learn new things quickly. They have a calm nature and are easy to live with as long as their exercise needs are being met.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Barbet is solidly built with adequate bone to perform his tasks as a true sporting dog, and as such is sturdy, with a moderately sized and constructed frame. Given the small genetic pool from which the Barbet draws, it is a surprisingly healthy breed thanks to wise, cautious selection by breeders. Responsible breeders screen for health conditions such as as hip and elbo dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), seizure disorders and allergies.","Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The proper grooming of a Barbet starts with a full brush-out, a comb through to the skin, and a good bath. An after-bath blow drying will straighten the hair and make a fluff ball ready for a scissor trim. An all-over trim to approximately 3 to 5 inches in length to show the shape of the body is preferred, while the head, ears and tail remain longer. For the purpose of showing, the hair on the head must reach the muzzle. After the trim, the Barbet must be wet down and left to air-dry to regain his natural curls.



 A Barbet's strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Bred as a marsh/swamp game retriever, the Barbet is an agile athlete and loyal partner in any activity, especially if it involves water. He actually has webbed paws specifically for swimming. Besides swimming, other options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks. The Barbet enjoys plenty of playtime with dogs and people, but is then content to lounge nearby indoors. He is happiest when well socialized and prefers not to spend too many hours alone.","Positive interactions and and upbeat training environment are needed for a Barbet, as the breed has a sensitive, but even, temperament. Training should be a relatively easy task, as Barbets are friendly, responsive, and agreeable. Agility, rally, dock diving, and lure coursing are all dog sports that Barbets have participated in, and make for great exercise and mental stimulation."

They are unique and beguiling pets, best for owners who can meet their exercise needs and the challenge of training this catlike canine.
Basenjis are small, graceful hounds standing 16 or 17 inches at the shoulder. They are recognizable by their glistening short coat, tightly curled tail, and wrinkled forehead and expressive almond-shaped eyes that convey a variety of subtle, humanlike emotions.

 Basenjis are a lovely sight at a standstill but more impressive yet at a fast trot, when they exhibit the long, smooth strides of a mini-racehorse. And yes, it's true, they don't bark, but they make their feelings known with an odd sound described as something between a chortle and a yodel. Basenjis are fastidious and will groom themselves like cats. This has been called a 'cult breed''¿small in numbers, but those lucky enough to own one do so with singular devotion.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Basenji are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen for health disorders such as hypothyroidism, a type of inflammatory bowel disease called IPSID and canine hip dysplasia. Gene tests are available to identify carriers of Fanconi syndrome, a kidney disorder, as well as progressive retinal atrophy, or PRA; such tests allow breeders to plan breedings that will not produce those diseases. As with all breeds, a Basenji's ears should be checked regularly, and the teeth should be brushed often.","Basenjis are fastidious creatures. Their short coat is a breeze to take care of, generally requiring no more than a quick once-over with a soft-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove every week. Brushing distributes skin oils throughout the coat to help keep it healthy and looking its best. Basenjis don't have a 'doggy' smell, and they usually don't need to be bathed unless they get into something particularly messy. As with all breeds, the Basenji'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","Basenjis are energetic, inquisitive, and very active. They require lots of regular exercise to keep them from becoming bored. Boredom can lead to destructive behavior. Long play sessions in a well-fenced yard or securely on lead are required. A Basenji should never run loose, as the breed's instinct to hunt is very strong, and the dog might not be able to resist the urge to run off on a chase. Giving the dog a structured outlet for those instincts and that pent-up energy can help immensely; many Basenjis enjoy, and excel at, canine sports such as lure coursing, tracking, and obedience and agility competitions.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all breeds, but given the Basenji's bountiful energy, intelligence, and penchant for mischief, they are a necessity. Basenjis are often described as 'catlike,' which may not seem to bode well for training them. However, they do learn readily in an encouraging and rewarding atmosphere, and with the use of positive-training techniques. They also lose interest quickly, so training sessions should last no more than five or 10 minutes."

It is equally an excellent companion dog, being cheerful, intelligent and eager to please.
The Basset Fauve de Bretagne, also known as the Fawn Colored Brittany Basset, is a small, stocky, rough-coated hardy dog that is energetic and fast for its size. The Fauve gets along well with children and other pets. Training and socialization is a must or Fauves can get into mischief. Not nuisance barkers, you will, however, know if a rabbit runs through the yard, as they then give the hound 'voice' and chase. This breed is as happy romping in the field as he is curled up next to the family on the sofa.

","The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a relatively healthy dog, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health concerns such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), epilepsy, cardiomyopathies, skin allergies and age-related thyroid issues. A gene test for primary open angle glaucoma is now available, meaning breeders are able to identify carriers and avoid producing this eye anomaly. The vast majority of Fauves are very healthy and enjoy longevity, with many living to be 16 plus years old. Working with a responsible breeder can help those wishing to own a Fauve to gain the knowledge they need about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize genetic testing of their breeding dogs to reduce the likelihood of problems with their puppies.","The Basset Fauve de Betagne is almost a 'wash-and-wear' dog, with a coarse, wiry coat that repels dirt and resists matting. Some dogs have more coat than others. Longhaired dogs can be hand-stripped. All require grooming weekly with a fine-toothed comb, followed by a stiff brush. Shedding is seasonal. Nails should be trimmed regularly to avoid overgrowth and splitting. Teeth should be brushed and ears checked regularly.","Basset Fauves are energetic and love to play. Regular walks need to be on a leash as they can run off and follow their nose at a moment's notice. Areas for exercise and play, such as a backyard, should be fenced for the same reasons. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.","The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a small scent hound, bred originally to find rabbits.

This low-slung and low-key hound can be sometimes stubborn, but is always charming.
The Basset Hound stands no higher than 14 inches at the shoulder but, with his remarkably heavy bone, powerful little legs, and massive paws, he possesses big-dog strength and stamina. Bassets are famous for a large, domed head that features extremely long, velvety ears, mournful eyes, and a wrinkled brow, which give the breed the look of a sad clown. Built more for endurance than speed, the Basset moves in a deliberate but effortless manner. The breed's scenting ability is uncanny; it's said that among dogs only the Bloodhound's nose is more accurate. Mild and agreeable at home, the Basset is stubborn on the trail and barks in a loud, ringing voice. Although they may not be wildly demonstrative in their affections, they are steadfastly loyal.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Because of the Basset's ears are long and droopy, it's important to check them frequently to ensure that air circulation hasn't led to an infection. Shaking the head or scratching at the ears may indicate the need for a vet visit. Responsible breeders check for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, bleeding disorders, and luxating patella, a dislocated kneecap once called a 'trick knee' in humans. Brushing your dog's teeth with specially formulated canine toothpaste at least twice a week is also a vital part of Basset health care.","Although it might seem that with his short, smooth hair the Basset Hound won't need any grooming, that's not quite the case. Regular grooming sessions are an important part of keeping the breed healthy and happy. The Basset's short hair can shed profusely. Shedding can be kept under control by gently going over the dog at least once a week with a soft brush or a shedding tool. As well as removing hair that is ready to shed, grooming is like an all-body massage that benefits his skin and overall health. The Basset will also need his nails trimmed regularly, and an occasional bath will help to keep his coat clean and shiny.","Basset Hounds are not as active as some breeds, but they do require regular, moderate exercise. Usually a daily walk at a moderate pace will fill the bill. Exercise will help to keep the Basset healthy and prevent him from becoming overweight. Since the breed was developed to work in a pack with other dogs, Bassets enjoy canine company on their outings, and the breed can be quite playful. After a walk or play session they'll typically settle down for a comfortable sleep.","Basset Hounds are very independent, and training the breed can be a challenge. Over the centuries, scenthounds of this type were developed to hunt on their own and to follow a track without distraction. Because of this, they can seem aloof and not interested in following your commands. However, a Basset definitely can be trained'¿it will just take time, consistency, and persistence. Using treats and early socialization in puppyhood is crucial, and as the Basset matures he and his owner can benefit from continued positive obedience training."

His coat is dense, close fitting and harsh, with little gloss, and is finer on the head and ears, and harsher and longer on the belly, legs and tail. The breed's strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Bavarian Mountain Scent Hounds are not suited for city life. They are in regular need of space and exercise. They are also not dogs for the casual hunter. Most are owned and used by foresters and game wardens. If not placed in a working home, the Bavarian will need an abundant amount of physical and mental stimulation to satisfy his high hunting instinct. He is not a kennel dog, but can be trained to sleep and eat there. Space to run and play in an area with a high fence is important, as they have been known to climb fences and dig holes when bored.","Bavarians are social, intelligent dogs, and, much like other breeds, if not kept mentally stimulated they will become bored, unhappy and destructive. Continued proper training, conditioning and patience are required. During training, they do best with positive reinforcement, never punishment."

They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing.
There are two Beagle varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15 inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches,' as dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle's fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a broad head.

 A breed described as 'merry' by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable, happy, and companionable'¿all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, luxating patella (a dislocated kneecap), and eye disorders. As with all breeds, a Beagle's ears should be checked weekly, and the teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Beagle has a smooth, dense double coat that gets heavier in the winter, so spring is shedding season. Beagles also shed moderately year-round. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will remove the loose hair, and promotes new hair growth as well. Beagles don't need to be bathed too often, unless they happen to get into something particularly messy. As with all breeds, the Beagle's nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","Beagles are active, energetic dogs who need at least an hour of exercise every day. This doesn't mean just letting them out in the backyard. Beagles were bred to work in packs and are happiest when they have company. A Beagle who is left alone inside or outside for long periods of time will tend to become destructive. This can be avoided if he has a companion (whether human or canine) to play with. Beagles are escape artists, so an exercise area must have a fence at least five feet tall that extends underground to prevent tunneling. Walks must always be taken on a leash, because as a scenthound with a very strong hunting instinct, a Beagle will not be able to resist the urge to run off in pursuit of a compelling scent.","As with all dogs, early socialization and puppy training classes are a must. Treats are a huge aid in training. Beagles do not respond well to harsh techniques, but patience, positive reinforcement and even a little creativity will win out in the end."

Bred to be independent decision-makers, they can be willful but are always friendly.
Standing 20 to 22 inches at the shoulder and covered head to tail in a shaggy double coat, Beardies bear a passing resemblance to another British favorite, the Old English Sheepdog. Beneath the coats, Beardies are the more lean and angular of the two. The lavish facial hair shouldn't obscure the characteristic expression: a dreamy, faraway gaze.

 These rambunctious comics can be a handful'¿but mostly, Beardies are approximately 50 pounds of heart, energy, and laughter. Well-socialized Beardies will get on nicely with other animals and kids. They bore easily, and training must be kept interesting. Outdoorsy families looking for a sturdy dog to share an uptempo lifestyle will never find a more affectionate and amusing sidekick.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Beardie is a sturdy breed, and responsible breeders screen their breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and eye problems. As with all breeds, a Beardie's ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and the teeth brushed daily.","The Beardie grooming regimen consists of two parts. The first is a daily brushing to remove tangles and foreign matter, which shouldn't take more than five or ten minutes, assuming the dog hasn't gotten into something messy. The second part is a weekly session with a pin rake, brush, comb, and possibly anti-tangle spray to remove dead hair and return the coat to pristine condition. This generally takes a half-hour to an hour. As with all breeds, the Beardie's nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","The Bearded Collie is an energetic, boisterous breed that requires a fair amount of outdoor exercise. Unlike many of their owners, Beardies are happy to run and play outside no matter what the weather. They need some sort of activity every day, whether playing ball; a long walk, run, or hike; or just playing in a large, fenced-in yard or other area with a companion, human or canine. And, of course, being bred to herd sheep, Beardies love to participate in athletic events such as herding, rally, agility, and obedience competitions. A busy Beardie is a happy Beardie.","As with all dogs, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of seven weeks and four months will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Puppy training classes serve as part of the socialization process and help the owner learn to recognize and avert certain undesired behaviors that may be developing. Like many other Herding breeds, the Beardie was bred to work out in the field on his own without any direction from people. This independent (some would say stubborn) streak can make training a challenge, but patient owners will eventually succeed in winning over their Beardies using positive reinforcement '¿ and lots of treats."

Beaucerons are muscular, rugged, and large, standing as high as 27.5 inches at the shoulder, and yet graceful and in all ways balanced. Their dark black coats feature handsome squirrel-red accents, including the red feet that give the breed its French nickname Bas-Rouge ('red stockings'). They're also seen in a black-gray-tan coat. The long head is well chiseled, and the dark brown eyes project expression breed fanciers describe as frank and confident. They're not for novice owners, who might end up being owned by their dominant dog instead of the other way around. That said, well-trained and socialized Beaucerons are levelheaded watchdogs and guardians, especially good with the young, the small, and the defenseless.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Any large or deep-chested dog may be susceptible to bloat, a sudden and life-threatening stomach condition. Beauceron owners should educate themselves on what symptoms to look for and what to do should it occur. Responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock health conditions such as hip dysplasia, heart disease, eye problems, and allergies. As with all breeds, a Beauceron's ears should be checked regularly, and the teeth should be brushed often.","The Beauceron has a short, dense double coat; the soft undercoat is covered by a rough, waterproof outer coat. It doesn't require a lot of grooming, but it does shed. A lot. And even more so twice a year during shedding season. Weekly brushing, daily during shedding season, with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will remove the dead hair before it can fall onto the furniture, and it promotes new hair growth as well. As with all breeds, the Beauceron's nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running. Don't forget to trim the double dewclaws on the rear legs.","The Beauceron is a powerful, athletic, and intelligent breed that needs lots of physical and mental challenges. This is not a breed for novice owners. They need a variety of outdoor locations and types of exercise each day and are best suited to an experienced, active owner who can provide the mental and physical activity they need. Although the Beauceron was not bred to gather sheep as other shepherd breeds were, he can be trained to perform in herding events, as well as Schutzhund (protection work) and agility trials and activities such as carting, mushing, and skijoring (pulling a person who is on skis).","Socialization and  obedience training are a must for this breed. Beaucerons are highly intelligent, loyal, and strongly devoted to their owners, which makes training them fairly easy. They do not respond well to harsh training methods, particularly physical correction. Firm, fair, consistent training and handling are usually quite successful. They are known for exuberant behaviors such as jumping on people and grabbing people and things with their mouths; these behaviors will often be the focus of early training sessions."

As the curvy contours indicate, there's sighthound'¿Whippet, most likely'¿in their family tree. Bedlingtons move with a light, springy step and when roused to pursuit can run like the wind.



 Rollicking, charming, and full of fun, Bedlingtons want most to be their family's center of attention and are known to be protective of loved ones. For an active family looking for a no-shedding, lively, and loyal companion, the search might end here.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","The Bedlington is generally a healthy breed, and responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for health conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, von Willebrand's disease (a bleeding disorder), thrombopathia, and certain eye issues. As with all breeds, a Bedlington's ears should be checked regularly, and the teeth brushed daily.","The crisp, curly coat of the Bedlington Terrier is a mix of soft and harsh, but not wiry, hair. While fastidious owners will be happy to learn that it virtually does not shed at all, it grows very quickly and needs to be clipped every two months. Many owners learn the process, which involves both electric clippers and scissors, while others are happy to take their Bedlington to a groomer. In addition, a Bedlington needs to be brushed and/or combed once or twice a week. As with all breeds, the Bedlington's nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","Bedlingtons, like most Terriers, have a fair amount of energy and require regular exercise to stay fit and happy. The breed is energetic, but not rambunctious or mischievous. A Bedlington loves to play fetch or go on a long walk or run, but afterwards he's happy to just curl up on the couch with his family. Despite their lamb-like looks, Bedlingtons were bred to chase small animals, and that's what they do. So they require a fenced-in yard and should be on a leash for all walks. Many Bedlingtons enjoy participating in agility, obedience, tracking, and earthdog competitions.","Early socialization and puppy training are recommended for all dogs. Though Bedlingtons can be stubborn, they are also both intelligent and eager to please. Bedlingtons do not respond to harsh training methods or physical correction, which can lead to a battle of wills rather than to obedience. Positive-reinforcement techniques, such as using praise and food as rewards, are much more successful."

Of the four closely related Belgian herders, the Belgian Sheepdog, Malinois, Tervuren, and Laekenois, the Laekenois is the rarest. This strong and sturdy dog is distinguished from his brethren by a rough, tousled coat that comes in shades of red or fawn or in grayish tones. The blackening around the muzzle points up the expression of keen watchfulness shining from the dark almond-shaped eyes. The Belgian Laekenois is protective of his master and property. Although observant with strangers, the breed is affectionate and friendly with those he knows well. The Laekenois coat requires regular brushing and occasional bathing, and as a working dog, it needs daily exercise.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Belgian Laekenois is a robust, healthy breed. Responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for various health conditions. As with all breeds, a Belgian Laekenois's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed regularly.","Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep your Belgian Laekenois clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The Laekenois' strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The ideal owner will understand that the Belgian Laekenois is not going to be happy sitting around nor can he be expected to live alone in the yard. Eager to please, Laekenois want to be with their humans, and need an active lifestyle and plenty of employment to be happy. When the new puppy arrives, it's important to get him socialized early, with frequent and positive meet-and-greet sessions, as these working dogs are typically reserved with strangers.","Socialization and puppy-training classes are especially important. They promote good behavior, nip bad habits in the bud, and strengthen the bond between puppy and owner.

To deny a Mal activity and the pleasure of your company is to deprive him of his very reasons for being.
Belgian Malinois are squarely built, proud, and alert herders standing 22 to 26 inches. Strong and well-muscled, but more elegant than bulky, there's an honest, no-frills look about them, as befit dogs built to work hard for their feed. A breed hallmark is the proud carriage of the head. Coat colors range from a rich fawn to mahogany. The black ears and mask accentuate bright, questioning eyes the color of dark Belgian chocolate.



 If you have ever seen a Mal perform an obedience routine, you know firsthand what a smart and eager breed this is. Problems set in, though, when this people-oriented dog is underemployed and neglected.

Occasional brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will keep the dog looking his best, and promotes new hair growth and distributes skin oils throughout the coat as well. Malinois do shed twice a year; during these periods, a daily once-over with a slicker brush will help to remove the loose hair. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","Highly intelligent, athletic, and muscular, and exceedingly devoted, the Malinois need to be actively engaged with his owner, both mentally and physically. This is not a dog who can be left in the backyard, and daily walks are not enough, either. Exercise, and plenty of it, preferably side by side with his owner, is paramount to the breed's happiness. To deprive a Malinois of activity and human companionship is to deprive him of his very reasons for being. Malinois make great running, hiking, and biking companions, and they excel at agility, tracking, herding, obedience, and Schutzhund (protection) competitions.","Like most herding breeds, Malinois have a high prey drive and are strongly interested in moving objects.

This is a breed built for hard work, and plenty of it. These sensitive souls crave human companionship and abhor neglect.
The stirring silhouette of a Belgian Sheepdog conveys both elegance and muscular determination. A handsome feature of the breed is the exceedingly proud carriage of the head and neck. A male might stand 26 inches at the shoulder; females are smaller. The dark eyes sparkle with a questioning intelligence, and the black coat is abundant, from the neck's 'collarette' to the 'breeches' of the hindquarters. In all ways, Belgian Sheepdogs are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.



 In any sport or activity, a Belgian will always give 100 percent. In turn, owners tend to form a special bond with their eager workaholics.

For most of the year, all a Belgian requires is a weekly brushing. Baths can be infrequent unless the dog gets into something messy. At least once a year, though, Belgians shed heavily. When this happens, a thorough brushing every day is required to remove the surprisingly large amount of dead hair. As with all breeds, the Belgian's nails should be trimmed regularly.","Like so many of the Herding breeds, Belgian Sheepdogs require a good amount of exercise every day. And because the Belgian is a sensitive soul who craves human companionship, just letting him out in the backyard for a couple of hours is not enough. Owners should expect to participate in daily exercise sessions with their Belgians. This might mean playing with a ball or going for a long run, or it could also mean training for and participating in obedience, agility, tracking, or herding competitions, or canine sports such as flyball.","Socialization and puppy-training classes are especially important.

 'Their intelligence and high activity level can be a challenge for the less creative individual who may not understand the breed's need to work,' warns one longtime owner. But don't get the idea that Tervs are grim, mechanical worker drones.

During shedding season, however, which occurs at least once a year, these sessions expand to 15 or 20 minutes and may become a bit more frequent, and a rake is added to the toolkit to help remove all the dead hair. As with all breeds, the Terv's nails should be trimmed regularly.","The Belgian Tervuren's AKC standard says the breed is 'always in motion, seemingly never tiring '¦.' So, yes, this is a dog who needs a lot of exercise every day. Lots of hard work and challenging play'¿preferably with his owner rather than by himself'¿are a Terv's idea of heaven. This is not a breed for everyone, and a Terv owner should expect to spend a good amount of active quality time with his canine friend. Its strong herding instinct and quick intelligence make the breed suitable for any number of activities, including herding, agility, and obedience competitions, mushing and Schutzhund (protection) activities.","Socialization and obedience training are a must for the Belgian Tervuren. Exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. A Terv's intelligence and independence can lead him into trouble if he's not trained to channel his boundless energy into acceptable activities. Tervs tend to be play oriented and surprisingly sensitive, which means that harsh training methods seldom work, but turning the task into a game always does.

Eager to please, smart, and stubbornly devoted to work, Bergamascos are patient but protective.
Beneath the one-of-a-kind coat is a large, muscular shepherd dog of ancient pedigree. But, since the coat is the breed's hallmark, let's take a close look. The Bergamasco Sheepdog has hair of three different textures that form naturally occurring loose mats, or 'flocks' (strands of hair woven together, creating flat layers of felted hair), covering the body and legs. The flocks provide protection from the fierce cold and wild predators of the Italian Alps, the breed's ancestral homeland. Bergamascos are bright, loyal, loving, and trainable' with a dash of mountain-dog independence. They take to watching over loved ones with a serene vigilance.

They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Bergamascos are generally a healthy breed. Like all breeds there may be some health issues. Some dogs may be faced with these health challenges in their lives, but the majority of Bergamascos are healthy dogs.","The coat of an adult Bergamasco is basically maintenance-free. It's made up of three types of hair, called 'dog,'  'goat,' and 'wool.' Goat and wool hairs don't start to appear until the dog is a year old. When they do, the coat must be ripped into mats, a process that can take a few hours or a few evenings. But once it's done, it's done. A Bergamasco doesn't shed, doesn't need to be brushed, and doesn't need to be bathed more than two or three times a year. Because the coat aids in thermoregulation, a Bergamasco should never be shaved down. As with all breeds, the Bergamasco's nails should be trimmed regularly.","The Bergamasco Sheepdog requires only a moderate amount of exercise every day. Because they bond closely with their owners, this exercise should come in the form of some sort of mutual activity rather than the dog being left alone in the backyard. And while they are generally calm, Bergamascos have a good deal of energy and are happy to join their owners in almost any sort of activity, whether that entails retrieving a ball, going on a brisk walk or hike, or romping together in an open field.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. The Bergamasco is a sociable, highly intelligent breed who possesses a deep desire to please his master. The breed thinks independently, however, and often sees itself more as an equal partner than as a subordinate to the members of his family. A Bergamasco who can be made to understand what is wanted of him, and why he should do it, will happily comply, if in his own way."

They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Berger Picards are generally a healthy breed. Like all breeds there may be some health issues. Some dogs may be faced with these health challenges in their lives, but the majority of Berger Picards are healthy dogs.","The Berger Picard's double coat consists of a soft, dense undercoat for insulation covered by a shaggy, wiry, waterproof topcoat. During shedding season, brushing every day or two with a rake and a slicker brush will remove the dead hair before it ends up on the floor and furniture. The rest of the year, a Picard only needs to be brushed once a month. The breed should be bathed only occasionally, and shampoos formulated for crisp coats are recommended. As with all breeds, the Picard's nails should be trimmed regularly.","Bred to work in the fields, the Berger Picard is active and athletic, with plenty of stamina and drive. This high-energy breed needs lots of daily exercise and mental stimulation. The Picard must have a good outlet for all his energy, or he may become destructive and unhappy. Owners should expect to go on at least one long walk every day. Picards also make excellent companions on hikes and bike rides, and they enjoy swimming and playing fetch. Many Picards participate in agility, tracking, obedience, Schutzhund (protection), flyball, French ring sport, rally, and herding competitions.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are a must. Training should begin as early as possible to prevent bad habits from developing. Picards have a stubborn streak, but they are very intelligent and eager to please, so training is usually fairly easy. They are more likely to respond to praise and affection than to food, and are unlikely to respond to harsh training methods."

Berners are generally placid but are always up for a romp with the owner, whom they live to please.
The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, sturdy worker who can stand over 27 inches at the shoulder. The thick, silky, and moderately long coat is tricolored: jet black, clear white, and rust. The distinctive markings on the coat and face are breed hallmarks and, combined with the intelligent gleam in the dark eyes, add to the Berner's aura of majestic nobility. A hardy dog who thrives in cold weather, the Berner's brain and brawn helped him multitask on the farms and pastures of Switzerland.



 Berners get along with the entire family and are particularly gentle with children, but they will often become more attached to one lucky human. Berners are imposing but not threatening, and they maintain an aloof dignity with strangers.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Berners are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for health conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia, blood disorders, some cancers, and progressive retinal atrophy. All large breeds are susceptible to bloat, a sudden, life-threatening stomach condition. Berner owners should learn what signs to look out for, and what to do should they occur. As with all breeds, a Berner's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","The Bernese Mountain Dog has a double coat, with a longer outer coat and a wooly undercoat. Berners shed a fair amount, even more so during shedding season, which occurs twice a year. Weekly brushing'¿daily during shedding season'¿will help to remove loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Any tangles can be worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog pain and structural problems.","Bernese Mountain Dogs need at least a half-hour of moderate exercise every day to stay healthy and happy. While they are definitely meant to live indoors with their human family, Berners enjoy outdoor activities and make great companions on long walks or hikes. Outdoorsy owners often take their canine companions camping and backpacking. Berners enjoy pulling young children in a cart, and some even participate in carting and drafting competitions. Other canine sports in which Berners participate and excel include agility, herding, obedience, rally, and tracking.","Early socialization and obedience training are important for all dogs, but especially so for breeds as large as the Bernese Mountain Dog. Berners are intelligent and eager to please, so they are usually easy to train. They are also affectionate and openhearted; their feelings are easily hurt, and so they don't respond well to harsh corrections or training methods. A Berner wants to be with his family, and undesirable behaviors can result if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time."

A good-size Bichon will stand a shade under a foot tall at the shoulder. The breed's glory is a white hypoallergenic coat, plush and velvety to the touch, featuring rounded head hair that sets off the large, dark eyes and black leathers of the nose and lips.



 Bichons are adaptable companions who get on well with other dogs and children. Alert and curious, Bichons make nice little watchdogs'¿but they are lovers, not fighters, and operate under the assumption that there are no strangers, just friends they haven't met yet. Their confidence and size make them ideal city dogs. Bichons train nicely and enjoy performing for their loved ones. Finally, there's the happy-go-lucky Bichon personality that draws smiles and hugs wherever they go.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Bichons are generally healthy dogs, and a responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as allergies, bladder infections, luxating patella, and cataracts and other eye diseases. Bichons may experience early tooth loss or complications from gum infection if dental care and regular tooth brushing are not a priority. To avoid ear infections, regular ear cleaning is recommended.","Bichons should be brushed at least two or three times a week, but every day is best. They need a bath and a clipping at least once a month. Owners who show their Bichons learn to do this, but most pet owners take their Bichon to the groomer every four to six weeks. The Bichon is considered to be relatively hypoallergenic, as the breed sheds very little because the shed hair is caught up in the undercoat. That shed hair has to be brushed out to prevent mats from forming. As with all breeds, the Bichon's nails should be trimmed regularly as well.","The Bichon is classified as 'somewhat active,' but that's an average. Long stretches of calm are interspersed with brief bursts of high activity, often just running through the house or around the yard. Daily play sessions, in addition to walks, are required. Another dog can be a fine exercise companion, but the Bichon will still need quality playtime with his owner. A fenced-in backyard is a good idea; Bichons are surprisingly fast, and if one makes a dash for freedom, he may be difficult to catch or to call back to you. Many Bichons enjoy participating in obedience, agility, and rally competitions.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Bichons have a reputation for being difficult to housebreak. In every other respect, however, they are very easy to train. For example, Bichons love to perform tricks and learn new ones quickly. They respond very well to training based on positive rewards, rather than harsh or negative methods. A Bichon needs to be with his family, and undesirable behaviors are likely to result if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time."

They maintain a charming, whimsical attitude well into adulthood. Carrying around a toy or two is not surprising.
The Biewer Terrier is a very dedicated, loyal family member and friendly with strangers. A large percentage of the Biewer Terriers are happy-go-lucky dogs, smiling when asked if they are happy. In spite of its small stature, the Biewer is a very hearty, athletic dog and an excellent hunter of vermin. They are lighthearted, have a childlike attitude and like to carry toys in their mouths. He is quick to alert you to company, but is not a constant barker. How do you pronounce Biewer Terrier?

","Like all breeds, there may be some health issues. Some dogs may be faced with these health challenges in their lives, but the majority of Biewer Terriers are healthy dogs. Sensitive GI systems are common in the Biewer Terrier, so they may have an occasional soft or discolored stool. Although not life-threatening, if your dog has persistent problems with diarrhea or discolored stools, you should take him/her to the vet immediately. The Biewer Terrier is a relatively healthy dog, with no known excessive issues. That being said, we recommend the following tests for dogs before breeding.","The Biewer Terrier has a long coat that requires daily brushing. There is minimal matting with the silkier coat, but the soft coats may get some mats. If you choose to keep your Biewer in a short coat, minimal grooming is needed. Good-quality products are recommended to keep the coat in its soft, silky condition.



 Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. Beyond regular brushing, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best, again using good quality products. Their nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Biewer Terrier is a rather mellow, easy-going dog. Their playful attitudes provide them with a natural means of self-exercising, along with the time spent playing with their human families. Indoor activities could include hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks. Biewers are also excellent on walks, quite agile and love to go on outings. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather.","The Biewer's dedication and loyalty make them the perfect family pet. Having a fun-loving, childlike attitude makes them a great companion for people of all ages and able to make friends with animals of any origin. Being extremely intelligent, they are easy to train, although potty training may take a little longer."

Black and Tans have an amazingly sensitive nose, long, velvety ears, and a sweet disposition. The coal-black coat features rich tan accents, including the distinctive 'pumpkin seeds' above keenly expressive eyes. These are big, strong hounds: A good-size male can stand 27 inches at the shoulder and cover ground with effortless, eager strides.  Black and Tan Coonhounds are sociable hounds. A lonely Black and Tan Coonhound will serenade the neighborhood with loud, mournful 'music.' Black and Tan Coonhounds can keep pace with the most active family, but they also can hog the sofa for hours on end. Hounds will be hounds: A passing squirrel can arouse Black and Tan Coonhound prey drive in no time flat, so a strong leash and sturdy fence are must-haves.

","The Black and Tan is typically a sturdy breed with few health problems, and a responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, cataracts, and thyroid issues. The Black and Tan's ears should be checked weekly for any signs of infection. As with all breeds, the teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Black and Tan Coonhound has a short, dense coat that is shed once or twice a year. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will remove the dead hair before it can fall onto the furniture. Grooming also promotes new hair growth and distributes skin oils throughout the coat to keep it healthy. Black and Tans should be bathed occasionally to keep them from developing a doggy odor. As with all breeds, the Black and Tan's nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","Black and Tan Coonhounds require a moderate amount of exercise every day, whether it's a play session in the yard or a long walk. Of course, these hounds were bred to hunt and have a very strong instinct to chase after any small animal they smell, so the yard has to have a tall, solid fence, and the walk has to be on a leash. An obvious option for exercise is, of course, a hunting trip, and not just for raccoons'¿the Black and Tan can be trained to help out hunting just about any kind of game, from squirrels to deer, if local ordinances permit. And, as one might expect, Black and Tans also enjoy participating in coonhound field events.","As with all breeds, early socialization and  puppy training classes are recommended. Black and Tan Coonhounds are intelligent, affectionate, and devoted and also have an independent streak. They can be trained, but it's best to expect compliance rather than blind obedience. Once they learn to do something, they'll be inclined to do it that way for the rest of their lives, so it's important to train the behavior correctly the first time. Black and Tans want to be with their families, and a dog left alone in a yard for long periods, bored and ignored, is likely to complain'¿loudly."

A trim with clippers every few months can be done by a groomer, but many owners learn how to do it themselves. As with all breeds, the BRT's nails should be trimmed regularly.","The Black Russian Terrier needs at least 30 or 40 minutes of exercise every day. He is eager to take part in brisk walks, long runs, bike rides, swims, and hikes with his owner. In the backyard, he and his owner can play with a ball or a flying disc. A BRT who doesn't get enough exercise will become unhappy and destructive, and one who doesn't spend enough time with his human family can develop aggressive tendencies. Many BRTs excel at canine sports such as obedience, agility, rally, and Schutzhund (protection) competitions.","An owner who is not willing or able to train a powerful, willful animal should not get a Black Russian Terrier. Socialization needs to start in puppyhood and continue throughout the dog's lifetime in order to prevent aggressive behavior.  Obedience training also needs to start as early as possible and should continue well into adulthood. BRTs are dominating and will become pushy with anyone they can intimidate. Training must be firm and consistent, but always reward based, never punishment based. The BRT is intelligent and learns quickly, but only if he is treated with kindness and respect."

Their most famous features are a long, wrinkled face with loose skin; huge, drooping ears; and warm, deep-set eyes that complete an expression of solemn dignity. Coat colors can be black and tan, liver and tan, or red. Powerful legs allow Bloodhounds to scent over miles of punishing terrain. As pack dogs, Bloodhounds enjoy company, including other dogs and kids. They are easygoing, but their nose can sometimes lead them into trouble. A strong leash and long walks in places where they can enjoy sniffing around are recommended.

","Like other large, deep-chested dogs, Bloodhounds can experience bloat. Bloodhound owners should educate themselves to recognize the symptoms of this life-threatening condition, and know what to do should it happen. Bloodhounds are notorious for eating anything and everything, which can often lead to vet visits. The Bloodhound's low-hanging ears should be checked daily for any sign of infection. In addition, check the Bloodhound's skin wrinkles daily for odor or irritation, and if needed wipe with a warm, wet cloth and then dry thoroughly.

He will benefit from long daily walks'¿always on a leash, as he may not respond to commands if he has found a scent to follow. Additional exercise time can come in the backyard, which must be securely fenced because Bloodhounds are great diggers and escape artists.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. With a Bloodhound, it's best to start  obedience classes early; they tend to become set in their ways, and it's better if the behaviors they hold onto for a lifetime are the behaviors the owner wants. Bloodhounds like to take charge, so an owner needs to be firm but kind. Training that involves positive rewards, such as treats and praise, is usually effective. The Bloodhound is affectionate and devoted and also stubborn and independent, so his training requires patience, consistency, and skill."

Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Bolos would make great apartment dogs, provided they would still have a moderate exercise schedule. As a calm, easygoing dog, they would do well as companions for retirees and seniors. Options for exercise could include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or taken for walks. Indoor entertainment, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks are excellent low-key activities for the low-energy, but playful, Bolognese.","Small dog breeds, such as the Bolognese, can be prone to ""small dog syndrome."" This is a human-induced behavior where the dog thinks he is the ""pack leader"" to humans and can lead to separation anxiety and timidity. Those wishing to own a Bolognese can gain the knowledge they need to know to prevent or correct this behavior."

These energetic dogs will settle down for cuddle time when the workday is done.
Borders are athletic, medium-sized herders standing 18 to 22 inches at the shoulder. The overall look is that of a muscular but nimble worker unspoiled by passing fads. Both the rough coat and the smooth coat come in a variety of colors and patterns.



 The almond eyes are the focus of an intelligent expression'¿an intense gaze, the Border's famous 'herding eye', is a breed hallmark. On the move, Borders are among the canine kingdom's most agile, balanced, and durable citizens.



 The intelligence, athleticism, and trainability of Borders have a perfect outlet in agility training. Having a job to perform, like agility'¿or herding or obedience work'¿is key to Border happiness. Amiable among friends, they may be reserved with strangers.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Border Collie is generally a very hardy and healthy breed, and a responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, progressive renal atrophy, deafness, epilepsy, collie eye anomaly, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and trapped neutrophil syndrome. A BC's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed regularly.","There are two types of coat in the breed. The rough coat is medium-length and feathered, while the smooth coat is shorter and coarser. Both are dense, weather-resistant double coats. Grooming is the same for both: going over the dog with a pin brush once or twice a week, more often if needed, to keep the coat free of mats, tangles, dirt, and debris. During shedding season, daily brushing is required. As with all breeds, the BC's nails should be trimmed regularly.","This high-drive, athletic breed is extremely energetic and requires daily exercise beyond just a walk around the block or a quick romp in the yard. They thrive when they have a job to do and space to run. A Border Collie who doesn't work must be provided with vigorous exercise every day. Clearly, this is a breed for an active owner, and not for someone who prefers to stay indoors or who travels away from home frequently. BCs often participate (and excel) in herding events, not to mention obedience, agility, rally, and tracking competitions, and sports such as flying disc and flyball.","Early socialization is especially vital with the Border Collie, entailing positive exposure to a wide variety of people and situations from early puppyhood through about seven months. Obedience training that starts early and continues throughout the BC's life will keep him happy and provide needed mental stimulation. Border Collies are highly intelligent and highly trainable and are superstars at canine activities such as herding, obedience, and agility. Due to their tendency to herd animals and people, they do best with older, well-behaved children. They love their families but may be somewhat reserved with strangers."

These plucky, happy, and affectionate dogs are popular pets in town and country. The wiry coat is an easy keeper.
Border Terriers, standing from 11 to 16 inches at the shoulder, are easy to recognize among other small terriers by their unique head shape'¿the breed has an 'otter head,' as fanciers say. Another distinguishing trait is that they are longer in leg than other small terriers. The wire coat can be grizzle and tan, blue and tan, wheaten, or red.



 Borders are described as 'hard as nails' when working, but at home they're good-tempered, affectionate, and trainable. Borders love exploring outdoors and make fine childhood playmates. Bred to be country dogs, Borders adapt well to city life'¿as long as they get plenty of exercise. Borders tend to get along with other dogs, but their hunting instincts can be aroused when cats or squirrels cross their path.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Border Terrier is generally a healthy breed, and and a responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, juvenile cataracts, seizures, heart problems, and allergies. Some Borders seem less tolerant of hot weather, so outdoor exercise should be kept to a minimum when the temperature gets above 85 degrees F.","The Border Terrier has a double coat: a hard, wiry outer coat over a soft, fluffy undercoat. Like most double-coated breeds, the Border sheds seasonally. Most of the time, a quick brushing every week or two is enough to keep the coat in good shape. During shedding season, owners can expect to spend a half-hour or so every day stripping out the dead hair, either with their hands or with a rake or stripping tool. The outer coat repels dirt, but bathing compromises this ability. Usually a dirty Border Terrier can be cleaned up with a towel and a brush. As with all breeds, the BT's nails should be trimmed regularly.","Borders are active dogs and need plenty of exercise daily. A brisk half-hour walk or play session with his owner and a ball or flying disc should be enough to keep a Border healthy and happy. Because of their instinct to chase small animals, a Border Terrier must always be walked on a leash, and play sessions must take place inside a fenced-in yard or other secure area. Terriers are diggers, so ideally any backyard fencing will extend underground for at least 18 inches. BTs enjoy participating in tracking, lure coursing, agility, and earthdog, as well as canine sports such as flyball.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are a must for Border Terriers. The breed's parent club notes: 'A Border was bred to think for himself, which can be both his most endearing and most frustrating quality. Told to stay, he will oblige for what he considers enough time, then slip off about his own business. Confronted, he will act sorry, since he really likes to please. Punish him harshly, and you will break his spirit. If you want a dog that is unfailingly obedient, don't get a Border Terrier.' Remember that Borders cannot resist a chase and should only be off leash in securely fenced areas."

In full stride, he is a princely package of strength, grace, and glamour flying by at 35 to 40 miles per hour.
Borzoi are large, elegant sighthounds. A mature male stands at least 28 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 105 pounds. Females will be smaller. Beneath the luxurious silky coat, Borzoi construction follows the ancient Greyhound template. One known as the Russian Wolfhound, Borzoi were bred to be swift and tough enough to pursue and pin their ferocious lupine quarry.



 In their quiet, catlike way they can be stubborn, and training is best accomplished with patience, consistency, and good humor. Affectionate family dogs, Borzoi are nonetheless a bit too dignified to wholeheartedly enjoy a lot of roughhousing. The sight of a cat or squirrel on the run will quickly stir their pursuit instinct, and fenced-in running room is a must.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Borzoi are generally healthy dogs,and a responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, osteochondritis dissecans, and progressive retinal atrophy. Like other large and deep-chested dogs, they can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening stomach condition. Owners should educate themselves as to what symptoms indicate this is occurring and what to do if so. Sighthounds, including Borzoi, are more sensitive to anesthesia than other breeds. As with all breeds, a Borzoi's ears should be checked regularly, and the teeth should be brushed often.","Like any long-coated dog, the Borzoi will shed a bit. In general, a quick brushing every day or two with a pin brush, slicker brush, and/or a comb will remove any loose hair and dirt from the coat. About once a year the Borzoi will shed more heavily for several weeks, and during this shedding season more frequent grooming is needed. Regular baths keep the Borzoi clean and looking his best. As with all breeds, the Borzoi's nails should be trimmed regularly.","Even though Borzoi are large, they are graceful, athletic animals who make good housedogs. They do need daily exercise, whether in the form of long walks or running in a securely fenced yard. Being sighthounds, they are apt to chase anything that moves, so they should always be in an enclosed area or on a leash. It is never advisable to allow a Borzoi to run loose. Borzoi enjoy doing activities with their owners and excel in canine sports such as agility and lure coursing.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Exposing the puppy to positive experiences with a wide variety of people, places, and situations will help him develop into a well-adjusted adult. Borzoi are intelligent and very affectionate with their owners, but are also independent and sometimes stubborn, so training may be a challenge. Patience and consistency are key. Overall they are usually gentle, well-mannered companions. Remember that Borzoi were bred to chase game, and any small animal that runs may trigger this response, so the breed should be on leash when on outings."

His impeccable manners have earned him the nickname 'The American Gentleman.'
Boston Terriers are compact, short-tailed, well-balanced little dogs weighing no more than 25 pounds. The stylish 'tuxedo' coat can be white and either black, brindle, or seal (dark brown). The head is square, the muzzle is short, and the large, round eyes can shine with kindness, curiosity, or mischief. Ever alert to their surroundings, Bostons move with a jaunty, rhythmic step.



 It's a safe bet that a breed named for a city'¿the Havanese or Brussels Griffon, for instance'¿will make an excellent urban pet. Bostons are no exception: they are sturdy but portable, people-oriented, and always up for a brisk walk to the park or outdoor cafe. A bright dog with a natural gift for comedy, the dapper Bostonian is a steady source of smiles.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Protecting the Boston Terrier's beautiful but prominent eyes is of special importance. The eyes should be checked daily for redness or irritation. Some owners carry saline eye drops to flush out dust or debris. Responsible breeders screen their stock for eye problems such as cataracts, corneal ulcers, and glaucoma, as well as deafness and patellar luxation (comparable to a ""trick knee"" in humans). Like all flat-faced breeds, Bostons can experience difficulty breathing when not given adequate shelter from excessive heat or humidity.","The Boston's sleek, fine coat does shed somewhat, though not a lot. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will help to remove the loose hair. A good brushing also promotes new hair growth and distributes skin oils throughout the coat to help keep it healthy. Bostons need to be bathed only occasionally, unless they get into something messy. As with all breeds, the Boston's nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","The Boston's need for exercise varies from individual to individual. For some, a brisk walk once or twice a day will be enough. Others will need more time to run and play every day and let off steam. Simply letting a Boston out into the backyard doesn't count as exercise'¿he'll probably just sit at the door waiting to be let back in. Left alone for long periods of time, a Boston will tend to become frustrated and develop undesirable behaviors. Throw him a ball or a toy, however, and he'll be more than happy to play with you. Participation in canine sports such as agility, obedience, flyball, and rally is an enjoyable way to channel the breed's energy.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Socialization'¿gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations'¿will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Treats make a great training incentive. Many Bostons are quite sensitive; for them, gentle corrections should be followed by warmth and praise."

Burly and barrel-chested, the tousle-coated dog of Flandres is from a time and place where a dog had to work like '¦ well, a dog. These smart and steady all-purpose workers make excellent watchdogs.
Standing as high as 27.5 inches, with heavy bone and powerful muscles beneath a weatherproof coat, and an impressive head accented by beard and mustache, Bouviers can do anything that needs doing in a barnyard or pasture except milk the cows. And yet, Bouviers are more than just farm equipment. Their sterling character, huge heart, and keen intelligence endear them to dog lovers the world over.



 The Bouvier work ethic must be accommodated, and happily the breed's versatility allows them to do myriad tasks. Bouviers are excellent watchdogs and guardians, and eager participants in dog sports, especially herding trials. These strong-willed dogs do best with owners who can devote ample time and space to a top-of-the-line working dog.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Bouviers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as Bouvier des Flandres myopathy, cataracts, deafness, ectopic ureters, epilepsy, glaucoma, hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, laryngeal paralysis, megaesophagus, elbow dysplasia, portosystemic shunt, and subaortic stenosis. Like all large and deep-chested breeds, the Bouvier can experience gastric dilatation and bloat. Owners should learn how identify this potentially life-threatening condition and learn what emergency steps to take to address it.","The Bouvier's coat needs brushing once or twice a week. A good slicker brush or pin brush and large comb will work for this. The beard may need cleaning at the same time, and the dog's toenails should be trimmed every week or two.","The Bouvier was bred to do everything that needs doing in a barnyard and pasture except milk the cows. They are happiest when they stay busy. A bored Bouvier can be a very destructive one. They are an excellent fit for an active household with an owner who hikes or jogs or even bikes. The Bouvier needs a large, enclosed exercise area where he can romp and play, preferably with other dogs or kids who will keep him in good condition both mentally and physically. Heavy exercise should be limited while he is a growing puppy.","The Bouvier is happiest when he has a job to do, whether that job is babysitting, herding, obedience, or guard dog or rescue work. Bouviers are easily trained to do almost any type of dog sport or activity, and they usually excel at it. They have a strong prey drive so should be well socialized from the start. They are consummate showmen and enjoy working or competing with their owner at their side. Extremely eager to please, once they know what you want them to do, they will do their best to satisfy you. This breed is well suited for search and rescue work and adapts to the training easily."

Bright and alert, sometimes silly, but always courageous, the Boxer has been among America's most popular dog breeds for a very long time.
A well-made Boxer in peak condition is an awesome sight. A male can stand as high as 25 inches at the shoulder; females run smaller. Their muscles ripple beneath a short, tight-fitting coat. The dark brown eyes and wrinkled forehead give the face an alert, curious look. The coat can be fawn or brindle, with white markings. Boxers move like the athletes they are named for: smooth and graceful, with a powerful forward thrust.



 Boxers are upbeat and playful. Their patience and protective nature have earned them a reputation as a great dog with children. They take the jobs of watchdog and family guardian seriously and will meet threats fearlessly. Boxers do best when exposed to a lot of people and other animals in early puppyhood.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Boxer does not have a high tolerance for either extreme heat or cold, and he should always be kept inside the house as a beloved member of the family. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, heart conditions such as aortic stenosis and cardiomyopathy, thyroid deficiency, degenerative myelopathy, and certain cancers. The website of the breed's national parent club, the American Boxer Club, provides in-depth details about the breed's health and care.","The Boxer's short, shiny coat requires very little grooming. A good once-over with a rubber curry-brush or a hound glove once or twice a week should keep him looking his best. The Boxer tends to be a clean dog, needing a bath only occasionally. His nails should be trimmed at least once a month unless naturally worn down on a hard surface, and to prevent tartar buildup his teeth should be brushed often'¿daily if possible.","Boxers are very playful, high-energy dogs. They need ample exercise every day, on leash or in a securely fenced area. The Boxer must never be allowed to run loose. The breed's heritage as a chaser of wild game means that they spend a good deal of time jumping and leaping about'¿as young dogs, they are constantly in need of reminders to teach them to stay 'down.' Because the Boxer is a powerful, active, and playful dog, he may not be the best choice for a very frail adult, nor for a small child who could be overwhelmed by a well-meaning but bouncy puppy.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital in channeling the breed's energy and exuberance in a positive way. Boxers are highly intelligent, but can become bored with repetition. They tend to have a mind of their own and are excellent problem solvers. Not always tolerant of other dogs of the same sex, most Boxers of opposite sexes enjoy each other's company. Boxers excel in a wide range of canine sports, including obedience, agility, and herding, and they perform brilliantly as service, assistance, and therapy dogs, and in roles such as drug detection and search-and-rescue."

Boykins are medium-sized spaniels, larger and rangier than Cockers but more compact than Springers. The breed's hallmark is a beautiful solid-brown coat. Colors range from a rich liver to a luscious chocolate. The large, feathery ears hang close to the cheeks, setting off an expression of soulful intelligence. Bred to work in the lakes and swamps of their native South Carolina, web-toed Boykins can swim like seals.



 For years, Boykins were known only to hunters of Carolina waterfowl and wild turkey. But lately, the wider world has discovered that the Boykin is as delightful at home as he is eager at the lake.

","Boykin Spaniels are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, juvenile cataracts, and exercise-induced collapse. The Boykin's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection and cleaned when necessary'¿this can be done with soft gauze and an ear-cleaning solution, which the dog's breeder or veterinarian can recommend. The teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","The Boykin's medium-length, wavy coat requires only minimal maintenance. A weekly brushing will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep him looking his best, and an occasional bath will help to keep him clean-smelling. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause discomfort and problems walking and running.","Boykins have moderate to high energy and require lots of exercise every day. They do best with active people, especially those seeking an athletic partner for activities like hiking, running, or biking. Regular exercise will help keep the Boykin healthy and happy.

The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in obedience, tracking, agility, rally, field events, and other activities that can be enjoyed by both dog and owner.","The Boykin Spaniel is a tough, energetic, and enthusiastic hunting dog, yet gentle and contented in the home. An affectionate and fiercely loyal personality is a hallmark of the breed, and Boykins make wonderful family pets. They thrive on companionship, enjoying the company of children and other dogs.

To avoid orthopedic stresses on their fast-growing bodies, Bracco puppies should be fed a balanced food and should not be run on hard surfaces such as on concrete or perform repeated high-impact exercises until at least one year of age. Check the Bracco's long, pendulous ears for ear infections, and use a veterinarian-recommended ear cleaner once or twice weekly to keep the ear clean and dry to prevent infections.","Bracchi Italiani are easy to groom. Their short coats require minimal care and their long ears require routine cleaning to minimize the risk of ear infections. Beyond that, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Their nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Bracco is a moderate- to high-energy breed that requires daily exercise and mental stimulation. This can be accomplished by running free in a safe, enclosed space or by scheduled exercises such as daily jogs. At least 30 minutes of exercise per day is needed, but more is preferred. Furthermore, to be happy, they need time each day spent with their family doing organized training or playing.","A Bracco needs a calm, patient trainer who is gentle but firm. This breed may be slightly independent, but for the most part, they are eager to please and are thrilled when they see they've made you happy. They are most suited to a home that will use their hunting ability and give them a job to do. However, in lieu of hunting, training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog the physical and mental stimulation he needs."

The breed's relatively small size and short coat well suits them as an ideal home companion for the family that hunts.
The Bourbonnais is an ancient breed that evolved in France during the 15th century in the historic province of Bourbonnais. By the 1800s, the breed was known amongst French hunters as a tailless pointer with distinctive fawn and liver ticking. The Braque du Bourbonnais has now gained a strong foothold in North America; some years there are more pups registered in the United States than its homeland of France. In English, he is the Bourbonnais Pointing Dog. He is kind and affectionate in the home and a serious, adaptable, intelligent hunter in the field.

","Most Bourbonnais Pointing Dogs are healthy dogs. Working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Braque du Bourbonnais can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize health screening and genetic testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","







 The Braque du Bourbonnais has a fine, dense, short coat. It is a little coarser, and sometimes longer, on the back. On the head and ears, the hair is finer and shorter.









 Beyond periodic brushing, the occasional bath will keep your Braque du Bourbonnais clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The breed's strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Options for exercise could include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.","The Braque du Bourbonnais requires relatively gentle handling.

They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Most Pyrenean Type French Pointers are healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for common health problems. Good breeders utilize health screening and genetic testing to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep the Braque Francais Pyrenean clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The breed's strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.",

The dashing good looks of these muscular Frenchmen radiate a distinct aura of Gallic romance and elegance.
Briards are herders known for a wavy coat of either gray, tawny, or black, and an impressive head topped by a peek-a-boo hairdo parted naturally in the middle. A luxurious beard and eyebrows accentuate an expression described as 'frank and questioning.' Standing between 22 and 27 inches at the shoulder, Briards are burly and rugged but move with a nimble-footed gait.



 They possess traits common to many other herders: trainability, brains, a protective eye toward family (especially kids, whom they regard as their flock), and wariness with outsiders. These are large, tireless dogs'¿it is said that just two or three Briards can handle 700 head of sheep'¿and novice owners might be overwhelmed by their work drive and zest for life.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Briard is overall a healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as cancer, hip dysplasia, congenital stationary night blindness, cataracts, corneal dystrophy, retinal folds, hypothyroidism, immune diseases, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and kidney disease. Discuss any questions or concerns with your breeder and veterinarian so you can make educated decisions regarding your dog's health.","Begin grooming your Briard puppy long before he really needs grooming. Make sure that you make grooming time a happy period he will look forward to in the years when grooming is a necessity and can take a long time. A Briard should be brushed several times a week, completely to the skin, using a good-quality pin brush. Using an undercoat rake can help eliminate a lot of dead hair and lessen shedding. The number of baths a Briard will need depends entirely on his lifestyle and the jobs he is doing. Frequency may range from weekly to monthly, to even less.","The Briard requires a job to be happy. Hopefully his job will be one that gives him a lot of exercise, as this is a breed that craves action. Their zest for life makes them great companions for hikers, bicyclers, and joggers. They need a large, securely fenced area where they can run free. Chasing a tennis ball thrown by his owner can help a Briard work off excess energy as well as giving him the human companionship he loves.","The Briard was bred to be able to make executive decisions without the aid of a human. Sometimes this can make them a bit difficult to train. They are eager to please, however, and when training methods are positive and the sessions kept lively, energetic, and interesting, the Briard's natural intelligence will have him at the top of the class. Briards learn quickly and have an excellent memory. They excel at almost any canine role or sport, from catching discs to search-and-rescue, to obedience and agility. Socialization should begin early and continue throughout the Briard's life."

Bright and eager at home, and tireless afield, Brittanys require a lot of exercises, preferably with their favorite humans.
Brittanys are smaller than setters but leggier than spaniels, standing about 20 inches at the shoulder. Their beautiful, boldly patterned coat comes in combinations of white and vivid orange and liver (reddish-brown). They are rugged and strong but smooth, clean, and quick afoot. The face has the 'softness' prized by bird-dog lovers; high-set ears convey the breed's essential eagerness.



 The zeal and versatility that make Brittanys peerless hunters can be channeled into dog sports. Obedience, agility, flyball, dock diving'¿you name it, this trainable breed is up for it. The Brittany is a nice fit for those seeking an all-purpose hunting partner, a dog-sport teammate, or a companion in sync with an upbeat, outdoorsy family life.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Brittany is a very healthy breed, with few genetic health issues. A responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health concerns such as hip dysplasia and eye disease. Ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and the teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Brittany's flat or wavy coat is mostly fairly short and requires minimal grooming. A once-over with a soft brush or hound glove and a quick comb-through of his featherings should keep him looking his best. For the show ring there is some light trimming done to neaten the dog's head and neck. The underside of the ears should be inspected regularly and wiped clean if needed, and the nails trimmed every month if not naturally worn down.","The Brittany is a bright, high-energy dog who is bred to hunt, and he needs lots of exercise. Brittanys are a good fit for those seeking an all-purpose hunting partner, a dog-sport teammate, or a loyal companion suited to a lively, outdoorsy family life. He enjoys long, brisk walks and hikes or running on a leash alongside his human, as well as a wide variety of activities that occupy both his mind and his body. As well as field trials, other canine events such as agility, FAST CAT® , and dock diving provide great outlets for the breed's talent and boundless energy.","The Brittany is lively and smart and has an upbeat, willing disposition. The energy, versatility, and extraordinary working ability that make Brittanys shine as hunting dogs can be channeled into dog sports. Field trials , obedience, agility, flyball'¿you name it, this trainable breed is up for it. Patient, encouraging training works best with these gentle souls. As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended."

A large, mastiff-type dog, the Broholmer is rectangular and strongly built with a wide, massive head. Around the year 1800, a Danish dog book described him as a very ordinary breed, especially around Copenhagen. His nickname was ""the butcher's dog,"" as he was often seen lying at the doorsteps of butcher shops. He was a protector of the home and a herder and guard dog of cattle at the farm and in the city's markets. Today, his size is the only thing that keeps intruders at bay. The Broholmer has a heart of gold, loves to snuggle, and always wants to be near you, though his preference is to sit on you. He is an excellent dog with children and other dogs, though because he seems to underestimate his size, supervision is recommended. This breed is also remarkably agile for his size and can do agility, fetch balls, and jump and catch frisbees. Anything you do, camping, hiking, picnicking, walks in the park, he will be more than happy to go along with you.

A sensitive companion for discerning grownups, the Brussels Griffon is smart, devoted, and comically self-important.
With this breed, you get a big personality in a 5-to-15-pound package. One look into his big, human-like eyes, and you'll be smitten. Griffs come in four colors red, black-and-reddish-brown (called belge), black and tan, and black and in smooth coats (like a Pug) or rough coats (like a Schnauzer). Their black muzzle and whiskers earned them the nickname 'bearded dogs' in old folk songs. The Griff's big black eyes described as 'almost human' coupled with a fringed beard and mustache covering his short muzzle, gives him the air of a worldly, French-speaking philosopher. Griffs come in four colors: red, black-and-reddish-brown (called belge), black and tan, and black and in smooth coats or rough coats. The Griff's body is thickset and sturdy, and he moves with the purposeful trot of a fellow who knows what he wants.  Griffs are alert, sociable, and easily trained. Although playful and energetic, their small size and sensitive nature make them a poor choice as roughhousing playmates for kids. They have a low threshold for loneliness and will stick close to their special human, providing years of love and laughter.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Griffs are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as heart problems, eye defects such as cataracts, and orthopedic problems such as patella luxation and hip dysplasia. Like all flat-faced breeds, Brussels Griffons can experience breathing problems in sunny, hot, or humid weather, and usually snore. As with all breeds, a Griffon's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","There are two types of Brussels Griffon, with two types of coats: smooth and rough. With the smooth-coated Griffon, weekly brushing'¿daily during shedding season, which is usually a week or two in the spring, and then again in the fall'¿and the occasional bath will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Rough-coated Griffons do not shed. Many have their hair'¿except for the distinctive beard'¿clipped short, either by their owner or a professional groomer. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","Griffons need at least a half-hour of moderate exercise a day to stay healthy and happy. They love to romp and play, and are happiest when doing activities together with their people. A game of chasing the ball is fun for both dog and owner. Their intelligence and trainability mean that many Brussels Griffons excel in canine events such as obedience, agility, and tracking.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all dogs and help to ensure that the Griffon grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. Griffs have a high degree of intelligence and bond strongly with their owners, which makes them easy to train. As with many toy breeds, though, housebreaking may take some extra time and effort. Griffons have a very sensitive nature, and they don't respond well to harsh corrections or training methods. A Griffon wants to be with his family, often following his person from room to room, and undesirable behaviors can result if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time."

These unique 'eggheads' are exuberant, muscular companions who thrive on affection and exercise.
Bull Terriers are robust, big-boned terriers who move with a jaunty stride suggesting agility and power. The breed's hallmark is a long, egg-shaped head with erect and pointed ears, and small, triangular eyes that glisten with good humor. Coats come in two types: white; and any other color (including an attractive brindle striping), either solid or with white markings. A well-made BT is the picture of muscular determination and balance. There are four keys to BT happiness: early socialization with dogs and people; firm but loving training; ample exercise; and lots of quality time with his adored humans. If these requirements are met, there is no more loyal, lovable, and entertaining companion. This is the ultimate 'personality breed.'","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Owners of potential sires and dams being bred should show proof of testing for kidney and heart issues, and pups should be tested for hearing before leaving the breeder. Dedicated breeders communicate with each other regularly and work together for breed health and the preservation of the breed's best qualities. Bull Terriers from good breeders who health-test usually become healthy, happy, family members.","The Bull Terrier's short, flat, harsh, and glossy coat requires minimal maintenance. A weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush or a hound glove will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. The ears  should be regularly inspected and cleaned if needed. The nails should be trimmed often, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort and problems walking and running.","Bull Terriers benefit from daily, moderate exercise that provides good mental and physical stimulation, such as nice, long walks with the family. The breed was developed for sport as well as to be a gentleman's companion and possesses great strength and agility. Participation in canine sports such as obedience, tracking, agility, and coursing ability tests is an enjoyable way to channel the BT's energy.","Owners should remember that the breed exhibits the tenacity and courage of the Bulldog but is also a member of the Terrier Group. This is an independent free-thinker with a higher commitment to 'fun and games' than to a work ethic. Bull Terriers operate on the principle that if it is fun, they will do it. If not, why bother? Make training fun, and they will excel. Positive reinforcement with food or toys is an excellent place to start. Bull Terriers can excel at a variety of dog sports (including agility, flyball, freestyle, weight pull, and carting) as well as in roles such as bomb detection, search-and-rescue and as service, assistance, health-alert, and therapy dogs. There is no limit to what Bull Terriers can do if trained in a positive manner with patience and humor."

You can't mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed brow, pushed-in nose, small ears, undershot jaw with hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait all practically scream 'I'm a Bulldog!' The coat, seen in a variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to 50 pounds, but that won't stop them from curling up in your lap, or at least trying to. But don't mistake their easygoing ways for laziness'¿Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are best spent in an air-conditioned room as a Bulldog's short snout can cause labored breathing in hot and humid weather.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Bulldog owners should be vigilant to ensure their dog does not become overheated. A Bulldog should not be left out in the hot sun unsupervised or without access to shade and water, and of course no dog should be left in an enclosed car in even mildly warm weather. If a Bulldog is overexcited or breathing too hard, his tongue will hang out unusually far and have a bluish cast instead of the normal pink. Immediate soaking with cool water and giving ice can help to cool the dog. The Bulldog Club of America provides additional detailed advice on Bulldog health and care.","An all-over brushing with a soft brush for 10 minutes two or three times a week will keep the Bulldog looking his best. During periods of heavier shedding, it can help to first use a rubber curry brush. The wrinkles on the Bulldog's face need to be regularly checked to make sure the skin is clean and dry, as food or moisture can get trapped and cause irritation or infection. A cotton ball dipped in peroxide can be used to clean the wrinkles, and cornstarch can be applied afterward to aid in drying'¿although neither should be used near the eyes. The ears and the area under the tail should be kept clean, and the dog's nails trimmed every two weeks or so.","Bulldogs are mellow and are happy to relax next to their owner's feet, but they also enjoy an occasional romp and going on walks. Moderate exercise will help the dog to stay trim. Very warm days are best spent in front of an air-conditioner, however, as the Bulldog's short muzzle can make breathing difficult in heat and humidity. Stairs and pools also present major safety hazards. Bulldogs enjoy wading in very shallow water, but they should never be allowed in water that's more than elbow deep unless supervised closely.","Bulldogs are sweet, devoted, and easygoing, and they want to please their owner. As with all breeds, early socialization is vital to help give the dog a good start in life. Puppy training classes are highly recommended as well and allow the owner to learn how to curb any undesirable behaviors. Bulldogs love to chew'¿most will enjoy chew toys their entire life. They also love to play tug-of-war, but it is important to teach the dog when he is young to release what's in his mouth on command. From the start the young Bulldog should also be taught to accept having people take food from his bowl while he is eating, so that he does not develop a habit of being protective of his food."

Bullmastiffs are the result of Bulldog and Mastiff crosses.
The Bullmastiff isn't quite as large as his close cousin the Mastiff. Still, standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 100 and 130 pounds, this is still a whole lot of dog. After the first impression made by the Bullmastiff's size, it is the large, broad head that conveys the breed's essence: the dark eyes, high-set V-shaped ears, and broad, deep muzzle all combine to present the intelligence, alertness, and confidence that make the Bullmastiff a world-class protector and family companion. Coats come in fawn, red, or brindle.



 These are biddable and reliable creatures, but as with any large guarding dog, owners must begin training and socialization early, while the puppy is still small enough to control.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Bullmastiffs are a large breed with heavy bone. Breeders strive to adhere to the standard and to avoid overdone animals. In order to do the job of a guard dog, this working breed must be mentally and physically sound. Responsible Bullmastiff breeders support the American Bullmastiff Association Health & Research Committee, and screen their breeding stock for cardiac issues, hip and elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism and eye problems. Like many dogs, both purebred and not, Bullmastiffs can develop cancer as well as bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen; owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur. Heredity and environment play roles in the health of the breed, so breeders and owners must work together in order to breed and raise healthy dogs.","Seasonal shedding is to be expected, though unusual hair loss should be noted as a possible problem. A balanced diet and a healthy environment are most important for coat health. Frequent grooming ensures that shedding can be managed, and dogs should be bathed as needed. The skin and coat should be monitored in order to ensure that dryness or oiliness are not issues. These can be related to diet, and sometimes to allergies.","Bullmastiffs enjoy daily exercise. Some are more sedentary, while others are very active by nature, but moderate exercise should be encouraged. Brisk walks and outdoor play are favorites of the breed, although secure fencing is a must for outdoor areas. Fencing is critical to ensure that the dog is safely contained and so strangers and unfamiliar animals do not intrude on the Bullmastiff's territory. Puppies should not be overexercised, especially during periods of rapid growth. Bullmastiffs are not the ideal breed for people who want a canine running partner, but they are great walking companions.","Early training and socialization are critical for Bullmastiff puppies. The breed can be quite strong willed, and dogs and owners will both benefit from training regimens instilled in puppyhood. Rules and routines should be put in place early and adhered to as dogs grow up. Many breeders will encourage new owners to enroll in local puppy classes in order to ensure that puppies are exposed to other dogs and that owners have access to training assistance and information. Bullmastiffs can excel in agility, obedience, rally, even scent work and tracking, so training should begin immediately and be a part of the lifelong bond between dog and owner."

This quick, medium-sized pasture dog is docile with family, aloof with strangers. The ever-alert Canaan is a vocal and persistent guardian of flock and home.
Canaan Dogs are lean, bushy-tailed dogs standing 19 to 24 inches at the shoulder. The coat is straight and harsh, and comes in various colors and patterns. Erect, expressive ears and dark almond eyes convey an inquisitive expression. Canaans move at a brisk, natural trot. They are rugged, agile, and apparently tireless, making them a nice fit for hikers and runners.



 Canaans are clever, confident, and territorial. They will end up ""owning"" passive owners who haven't establish themselves as top dog in the family pack. Early training and socialization are key.

They are highly intelligent and readily trained. Although the dogs are adaptable to most climates and living situations, their natural drive for self-preservation and a well-developed sense of territory make them mistrustful of strange people, strange dogs, and new environments; early socialization and puppy training classes are a must. This is a process that should begin with the breeder and continue with the new owner and helps to ensure a well-mannered and well-adjusted dog both at home and in public.

At nearly 28 inches at the shoulder and often weighing more than 100 pounds, with a large head, alert expression, and muscles rippling beneath their short, stiff coat, Corsi are at a glance intimidating creatures. Their imposing appearance is their first line of defense against intruders. As one writer put it, 'An understated air of cool competence, the kind of demeanor you'd expect from a professional bodyguard, is the breed's trademark.'



 Corsi are intelligent, loyal, eager to please, versatile, and intensely loyal to their humans, but are also assertive and willful, and can end up owning an unwitting owner. As with any other big guardian dog, responsible breeding and early socialization with people and other dogs is vital.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Cane Corsos are generally healthy dogs,and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, idiopathic epilepsy, demodex mange, and eyelid abnormalities.vLarge and deep-chested breeds are susceptible to bloat, a sudden, life-threatening stomach condition. Cane Corso owners should learn what signs to look out for, and what to do should they occur. As with all breeds, a Cane Corso's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","The Cane Corso's coat is short, but double-layered. The undercoat, which varies in length depending on the climate the dog lives in, sheds throughout the year, especially during shedding season in the spring. Weekly brushing'¿daily during shedding season'¿with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will remove the dead hair before it can fall onto the furniture, and it helps remove dirt and promotes new hair growth as well. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","Cane Corsos need serious exercise. A brisk walk'¿or better yet, run'¿of at least a mile in the morning and again in the evening will sustain their health and muscle tone. They make great companions on long walks, hikes, or bicycle rides. The Cane Corso was bred to work and is happiest when given a job to do. He needs mental as well as physical stimulation, or undesirable behavior will result. Many Cane Corsos compete in agility, obedience, dock diving, protection sport, and tracking events.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all dogs, but for a breed as big and strong as a Cane Corso, they are a must. Many Cane Corsos can be dominant and protective; socialization will help ensure that they grow into well-adjusted, well-mannered adults. Obedience training will keep them from becoming the boss in the household. Cane Corsos are intelligent and eager to please, so they are generally easy to train. Despite their appearance, Cane Corsos are all heart, and respond to love and rewards far better than to harsh corrections or training methods."
68,Cardigan-Welsh-Corgi,10.5-12.5 inches,30-38 pounds (male),12-15 years,4,4,3,3,2,1,Double,Medium,4,4,3,3,4,4,5,4,68 of 202,Black & White-Blue Merle & White-Brindle & White-Gray & White-Liver & White-Red & White-Sable & White-Sable Merle & White-White Merle-Brindle Merle & White-Red Merle & White,Ticked-Tan Points-Black Mask-Brindle Points-Black Mask & Ticked-Brindle Points & Ticked-Tan Points & Ticked,"The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is a masterpiece of the breeder's art: Every aspect of its makeup is perfectly suited to moving cattle, and yet it is so congenial and sweet-faced that it would be a cherished companion even if it never did a day's work.
Long, low-set dogs with sturdy bone, short legs, and a deep chest, Cardigans are powerful workers of deceptive speed and grace. Cardis can weigh anywhere from 25 to 34 pounds, with females at the lower end of the scale. They come in several coat colors, from red to the popular blue-merle pattern. The quickest way to distinguish Cardis from their cousins, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, is to check out the hindquarters: Cardigans have tails; Pembrokes do not.



 Cardis are trainable, faithful, and vigilant guardians with a 'big dog' bark. Well-socialized Cardis are especially fond of kids and agreeable with other pets. These athletic, rugged herders have a love for the outdoors, and they thrive on mental stimulation and physical activity.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Cardigan is in general a very healthy breed, and responsible breeders  will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and degenerative myelopathy. And as with any 'long and low' canine, one must be cognizant of potential back issues. Avoid letting the Cardigan jump down off the bed or couch, and stairs can also be a hazard. At the first sign of any distress or discomfort, see the vet right away. The sooner a problem is caught, the quicker the recovery.","A good brushing at least once a week should keep the Cardigan's coat healthy and looking its best. Keeping the hair trimmed on the bottom of the feet helps to reduce the amount of dirt that an animal can bring into the house every day. The nails should be kept trimmed as well. Some pet owners mistakenly feel they should have their dog trimmed short for the summer. When the coat of the Cardigan is correct for the breed, this isn't necessary. The correct coat has the essential characteristics to maintain proper body temperature, as long as conditions are normal. It should be noted, however, that a black dog will absorb more heat on a sunny day, and care should be taken to avoid overexposure during hot weather.","The Cardigan is noted for being a very adaptable dog. If you want to hike and go on adventures, they are all for that. Or if you want to watch TV and eat popcorn, no problem'¿the Cardigan is there for you. Cardigans thrive on regular socialization, so going for walks in the neighborhood is important for many reasons. It provides fun for both you and the dog, as well as much-needed exercise. When your Cardigan unexpectedly starts to do 'power runs' through the house and over the couch, it is his way of saying, ""Hey, mom, I really need to burn off some fun'¿let's go play ball!"" And, yes, most Cardigans are 'ball-o-holics.' Use that to your advantage. Remember to avoid jumping and stairs, which can cause back injury.","It cannot be stressed enough that early and regular socialization is of the utmost importance in the developing a happy, healthy Cardigan. Gently expose the pup to a wide range of people, places, and situations. This process goes on for a lifetime, but the rewards of a well-socialized dog are wonderful. Go to training classes, and let all members of the family participate. Don't tolerate inappropriate behavior, and don't hesitate to seek the help of a qualified trainer or behaviorist if there's a problem you can't correct. A little effort early on will reward you with a dog whom you and all who meet him will love."

A sighthound of medium build, they have the general appearance of a jackal or wolf.
Carolina dogs are descended from the canines that accompanied the Paleo-Indians who traveled from Asia to North America over the Bering land bridge. Today, they can still be found living wild near the Georgia-South Carolina border, but have also been seen as far north as Ohio and Pennsylvania and as far west as Arizona; rural areas are the common denominator. The typical Carolina dog has pointed ears, a fox-like snout and a tail that curves like a fishhook when it is raised. They look similar to Australian Dingoes but, taxonomically, they fall under canis familiaris. Hesitant with strangers, they will sound the alarm when unaware of who's at the door, but once they see their people, they are ecstatic. Carolina Dogs have an extreme pack mentality, as this was a necessity for survival in the wild.

","In general, Carolina Dogs enjoy good health. Recent studies have shown that some are ivermectin sensitive, so discuss this with your veterinarian before administering any antiparasitic medications. Working with a responsible breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize health screenings and genetic testing to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","Minimal grooming is needed for Carolina Dogs. They tend to keep themselves clean much like a cat; however, occasional bathing may be necessary. These dogs do not require any special grooming techniques other than brushing and nail trimming. Coat length is short to medium, though, some dogs in the northern regions have developed a longer hair length. Coat density is effected seasonally, generally heavier in the cooler months and lighter in the warmer months. In cooler months, there should be a very pronounced undercoat. Short and smooth hair is found on the head, ears and front legs. Coarse, long guard hairs are on the neck, withers and back. When aroused, these hairs stand erect.","Like any other dog, the Carolina Dog requires exercise. These are not high-energy dogs, but should have some form of daily exercise. Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.","Carolina Dogs are very easily trained, eager to please, and may or may not respond to treat training. They excel in competitive activities and hunting small game."

They are serious while working and playful at home.
The Catahoula Leopard Dog is a medium-large, short-coated dog, known for its many varied coat and eye colors and patterns. The word  is of Choctaw origin and is translated to mean ""sacred lake."" Catahoulas are the only breed of dog to have historically originated in the state of Louisiana. The breed requires firm guidance and early socialization, as they can be independent, territorial, and protective. For the same reasons, they do not allow mistreatment and will assert themselves in self-defense. Once they know their place in the family unit, they are affectionate, loyal, and gentle. Also called the Catahoula Hog Dog, they are used as stock dogs, bay dogs, tree dogs, watchdogs, guard dogs, and of course as loyal companions.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Issues such as hip dysplasia, deafness, and eye problems have occasionally occurred in the Catahoula Leopard Dog. Some dogs may be faced with these health challenges in their lives, but the majority of this breed are healthy dogs. Working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Catahoula Leopard Dog can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize genetic testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep your Catahoula clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The breed's strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Catahoula Leopard Dog needs space to expend his copious amount of energy and always needs a job to do. He is not suited for the city or as an apartment dog. Without the proper amount of exercise and attention, he will start to cause trouble digging holes and chewing things. Options for exercise could include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or taken for walks several times a day. Outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, and retrieving balls or flying discs can also provide a good outlet for expending energy. Note: he is an excellent swimmer! Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.","Without training and mental stimulation, this breed can become destructive in the home. Due to his independence and territorial instincts, becoming well-socialized is also very important for the Catahoula to be a gentle and affectionate companion in the home. Though working like an adult at the early age of 10 months, Catahoulas are not fully matured until they are 2 years old. Therefore, it is important to make all jobs and exercises fun so as not to cause burnout at too early an age."

The Caucasian is bold, fearless, self-confident and fierce when a threat is present, but he is soft, devoted, kind and endearing to his family, including other family pets.
Caucasian Shepherd dogs were used for centuries to protect properties from trespassers, guard livestock from large and small predators such as wolves and coyotes, and for many other duties. In modern days, especially in the West, they're most commonly companions and watchdogs. There is a great variety of types among the Caucasian dogs depending on their home region. For almost a century, there has been two breed types and standards: The Mountain type, which is long-coated and has a heavier body mass than the Steppe type, a shorter-coated dog with a lighter body mass. Other names for the breed include Caucasian Ovcharka, Caucasian Sheepdog, Kawkasky Owtscharka, and Kaukasische Schaferhund.

Cavaliers are the best of two worlds, combining the gentle attentiveness of a toy breed with the verve and athleticism of a sporting spaniel.
The Cavalier's all-around beauty, regal grace, and even temper mark him as one of dogdom's noblemen. A toy spaniel no more than 13 inches high, the Cavalier draws you in with his face: The sweet, gentle, melting expression emanating from large, round eyes is a breed hallmark. Another is the silky, richly colored coat that can be one of four distinct varieties (described in this page's History section).



 Cavaliers may be aristocrats, but they gladly descend from their royal high horse for a backyard frolic or a squirrel chase. They get along nicely with children and other dogs. Adaptable Cavaliers do equally well with active owners and homebodies'¿they can be upbeat athletes or shameless couch potatoes, depending on an owner's lifestyle.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","There are several health issues that Cavaliers are prone to. These include certain eye conditions (including retinal problems and cataracts), patella luxation, hip dysplasia, middle ear infections, mitral valve heart disease, and a neurological condition called syringomyelia. Cavaliers can be screened for all these conditions, and most live comfortably into old age. Owners should discuss any potential health issues with their dog's breeder. A responsible breeder will health-test all potential breeding stock.","The Cavalier's lustrous, silky coat requires little more than regular brushing and an occasional bath to keep him in beautiful condition. Brushing not only helps to keep the coat shiny and tangle-free but also serves as a full-body massage that the dog enjoys. grooming sessions enhance the dog-owner bond and provide an opportunity to inspect the dog's whole body for any new or unusual bumps or other issues. The ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, and the nails should be trimmed at least once a month, as overgrown nails can cause pain and structural problems.","Although the Cavalier was bred to be a beloved lap dog, he is descended from sporting dogs and does enjoy moderate exercise and outdoor activities. He will happily go on walks with his owner and also performs well in a number of canine sports, but he's just as glad to stay on the sofa all day. Cavaliers should not be allowed off leash because they retain scenting and hunting instincts, and they may not come when called if they've found an interesting trail to follow or a creature to pursue. A fenced yard is recommended.","The Cavalier is a sweet, gentle, and affectionate breed, very eager to please their human. They are friendly with strangers and with other animals, and they can do very well with children. They are smart and train easily, and Cavaliers excel in a number of canine sports including obedience, rally, and agility. With their sweet nature they also make fantastic therapy dogs. As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes will help the young Cavalier to learn good manners and be comfortable with a wide variety of people and situations."

They are tenacious at work, but a little more laid back and tractable than the usual terrier.
Ceskys are muscular, short-legged, and handsome hunters standing no taller than 13 inches at the shoulder. The fine, silky coat comes in several shades of gray, including a stunning platinum. Wavy facial hair gives Ceskys a sporty, Continental look, and the medium-long neck lends a dash of elegance to these game, unspoiled working terriers.



 While Ceskys are as determined and prey-driven as any other earthdog, they're mellower than a typical terrier. Wary of strangers and protective of loved ones, they're good watchdogs without being particularly yappy. They train well and want to please. Here's the catch: They are a scarce breed, with only about 600 living in America.

","With a small gene pool in the States, breeders are doing their best to eliminate genetic health problems that are currently possible in the breed. These include patellar luxation (slipped stifles), cardiac problems, progressive retinal atrophy, and cataracts. Many suffer from a neurological issue known as Scotty Cramp, a somewhat debilitating but not life-threatening disorder that causes your dog to spasm, affecting his movement. Your breeder can discuss the potential health problems with you and help you make informed decisions about your dog's health. You should receive copies of the certification of the testing of your dog's parents.","Unlike grooming of some terrier breeds, hand stripping is not suggested for the Cesky's coat. Instead, the body is clipped. You should visit a professional groomer referred by your breeder to be sure your dog is groomed correctly. There are so few Ceskys around that it is unlikely that most groomers have ever even heard of the breed. In between groomings, as the Cesky coat does not shed dirt as some harder coats do, he will need regular baths. They tend to grow a lot of hair in the ears, and this should be removed during each grooming appointment to prevent an ear infection. Ears should be cleaned regularly to remove excess wax and other debris.","The Cesky enjoys daily exercise in the form of walks and play sessions with his owner. He must always be on a leash when not within a securely enclosed area, however, and his yard should be fenced. The breed has a very strong prey drive, and if he sees or smells what he perceives as prey, the Cesky may not be able to resist running off in pursuit.","The Cesky Terrier is considered to be a little less stubborn and thus more easily trainable than some other terrier breeds. They still require a firm hand in a kid glove. They will shut down if faced with negative or harsh training methods, so exercise only a positive, reward-based approach to training. Cesky Terriers are extremely intelligent, sensible, and feisty, which makes them a good candidate for training for dog sports. They have a very high prey drive, however, which should be squelched from the beginning."

Chessies are solid-colored, either chocolatey brown, sedge, or deadgrass, with keen yellow-amber eyes that nicely complement the coat.



 Chessies are more emotionally complex than the usual gundog. Chessies take to training, but they have a mind of their own and can tenaciously pursue their own path.

Idiopathic epilepsy is also known to occur in the breed.","The two coat varieties of the Chihuahua have slightly different grooming needs. The smooth-coat Chihuahua will need only occasional brushing and regular baths to look dapper, while the longhaired variety should have his coat brushed at least once a week to avoid any tangles or mats. Both varieties should have their nails trimmed regularly. Good dental care is necessary and should include brushing your dog's teeth, and the vet might also recommend treats designed as part of a tooth-care program. Check the Chihuahua's ears regularly, and remove any excess wax or debris to avoid ear infections.","The Chihuahua loves to run and play and can usually get enough exercise in a very small space. Simply trotting around following their people is usually enough exercise for this happy breed. Short, slow walks will keep your dog in good weight and condition. Avoid overexerting the Chihuahua.

He is eager to please his humans and responds well to positive training practices. Chihuahuas seem well aware of how cute they are and learn how to get their way. From the very beginning you must enforce the fact that you are in charge. Never allow your Chihuahua puppy to do anything that will be unacceptable in an adult. They can have a bit of a 'terrier' temperament, so a firm but gentle hand is necessary when training. They can excel in obedience training and other canine sports."

This frolicsome, ultra-affectionate companion dog is truly a breed apart.
The Chinese Crested, a lively and alert toy breed standing between 11 and 13 inches high, can be hairless or coated. The hairless variety has smooth, soft skin and tufts of hair on the head, tail, and ankles. The coated variety, called the 'powderpuff,' is covered by a soft, silky coat. Besides the coat, there's very little difference between the powderpuff and his undressed brother. Both varieties are characterized by fine-boned elegance and graceful movement.



 Cresteds are as fun as they look: playful, loving, and devoted to their humans. The hairless has its advantages: there is no doggy odor, and for obvious reasons shedding isn't much of a problem. Both varieties are attentive housemates, totally in tune with their family.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Responsible breeders consistently screen their breeding stock for inherited eye problems that are known to occur in the Chinese Crested, including progressive retinal atrophy, glaucoma, and primary lens luxation. Epilepsy occurs in the breed occasionally. Patellar luxation (slipped stifles) affects Cresteds, as it does most small breeds. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease has no DNA test to screen parents, but it does sometimes show up on X-ray.","You might think that the hairless variation of the Chinese Crested would require almost no grooming. After all, he has no hair. However, because his skin is exposed, the hairless Crested is prone to skin irritations, allergies, and sunburn. Careful grooming, including skin treatments specifically for your dog's skin type, sunscreen, and acne lotions are necessary to maintain a healthy pet. The Powderpuff version needs to be brushed daily to maintain his fluffy coat. The Powderpuff's coat is different than that of most other dogs. The undercoat is shorter than the longer overlay, which is the opposite of most haired breeds. This makes them easier to brush, but the coat can mat quickly.","The exercise needs of the Chinese Crested can usually be satisfied with daily short walks with his owner and play-sessions in his backyard. It is good for the Crested to exercise outdoors, but care must be taken to use either sunscreen or place protective clothing on him. These are tough little dogs who can be very competitive in canine sports.","The Chinese Crested loves to spend time with his owner. This makes him a great candidate for competitive sports such as agility, flyball, and obedience, and they make great therapy dogs. They also enjoy and do well at lure coursing. They have a very sensitive nature and must be trained with gentle patience. Harsh words and negative actions on your part can damage your relationship to the point that he will not be interested in learning further from you."

The Chinese Shar-Pei has physical characteristics that make him a one-of-a-kind companion and guardian dog.
The compact, medium-sized Chinese Shar-Pei is an amalgam of odd physical traits: a broad 'hippopotamus' muzzle; a blue-black tongue; small, sunken eyes with a scowling expression; tiny triangular ears; abundant folds of loose skin about the head, neck, and shoulders; the tapered high-set tail'¿all blanketed by a harsh, sandpapery coat. (A literal translation of Shar-Pei: 'sand skin.')



 Shar-Pei are strong, regal, independent guardians famous for intelligence and loyalty. They are suspicious of strangers and other dogs. Shar-Pei are serene dogs, but they will meet a perceived threat with tenacity and vigor. Early training and socialization are essential'¿a dominant adult Shar-Pei without them is a serious problem waiting to happen.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","There are some unusual and specific health concerns in the Chinese Shar-Pei breed. One of the major problem areas is the eyes; eye disorders including entropion, glaucoma, retinal dysplasia, and SARDS are known to occur in the breed. Other conditions that can occur include respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, immune-mediated, skin, and gastrointestinal disorders, and certain cancers. The website of the breed's national parent club, the Chinese Shar-Pei Club of America, provides detailed breed-health information for owners.","The Chinese Shar-Pei requires only minimal grooming. They need a bath only every month or so. Nails should be trimmed once a week, ideally using a grinder. The ears should be cleaned weekly, but don't overdo the products. The pup should be accustomed at a young age to having his ears cleaned regularly. Do not use cotton swabs, and do not use hydrogen peroxide. The best way to clean the ear canal is to ""float' debris out of the canal using an ear-cleaning solution. A wide variety of good solutions are available on the market and from the veterinarian.","Individual dogs Shar-Pei vary in their exercise needs. This is a very adaptable breed. They can do well with a very active owner, walking every day, or living in an apartment with a few short walks. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in obedience, tracking, agility, rally, and other activities that can be enjoyed by dog and owner.","One breed expert says, 'Get a jump-start on basic obedience, and don't let the dog be the boss!' Shar-Pei are smart and willing, but sometimes they are stubborn and a bit too smart, thinking of new ways to do things you may not be thrilled with. If you teach them with love and consistency, however, they are a joy. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Shar-Pei grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."

Once on the verge of extinction, the Chinook is among the scarcest AKC breeds.
Tawny-coated, no-frills Chinooks are muscular and substantial, with males standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder. Females, with their distinctly feminine look, are a bit smaller. Chinooks were conceived as dual-purpose haulers, with the power of freighting dogs and the speed of sled racers. They are the picture of stouthearted dignity, with a kindly twinkle in their dark, almond eyes.



 Chinooks are calm, people-oriented dogs with a special feel for children. They are trainable workers who aim to please. Sledding, carting, obedience, agility, search-and-rescue work, and herding are a few pursuits they've mastered. Chinooks are not particularly busy dogs, but they need consistent exercise to stay in proper hard condition.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Chinook is a robust, healthy breed, but there are certain health conditions that it is prone to. These include hip dysplasia, cryptorchidism (the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum), gastrointestinal disorders, and allergies. Some Chinooks suffer from a condition called 'Chinook seizures,' although it is generally thought to be a movement disorder and not true seizures. As with all breeds, a Chinook's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often.","The Chinook's plush double coat is fairly easy to care for. Like all mammals, Chinooks shed a bit throughout the year. Weekly brushing will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Longer, daily brushing sessions will be required during shedding season, which generally occurs twice a year, but happens more often with spayed or neutered animals. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","While they often appear relaxed and mellow around the house, Chinooks have a tremendous amount of energy, and they thrive on exercise and play. Because they bond strongly with their owners, they make great companions on long walks, hikes, bicycle rides, and camping trips. They even enjoy swimming and boating with their human family. Of course, Chinooks were bred to pull sleds, so it's no surprise that they excel at sports such as sledding, skijoring, bikejoring, and scootering. Chinooks also enjoy participating in agility, obedience, rally, tracking, and lure coursing events.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all dogs and help to ensure that the Chinook grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. Chinooks are easy to train using positive reinforcement techniques. Unlike most sledding breeds, they can be reliable off-leash. Chinooks, especially young ones, are enthusiastic and affectionate, and they tend to jump up and go face to face with human friends and family members unless they are trained early on not to do so. Because of his friendly, confident, outgoing personality, no amount of training will make a guard dog out of a Chinook."

Dignified, serious-minded, and aloof, the Chow Chow is a breed of unique delights.
Chows are powerful, compactly built dogs standing as high as 20 inches at the shoulder. Their distinctive traits include a lion's-mane ruff around the head and shoulders; a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that add to a scowling, snobbish expression; and a stiff-legged gait. Chows can have rough or smooth coats of red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream.



 Owners say Chows are the cleanest of dogs: They housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are known to be as fastidious as cats. Well-socialized Chows are never fierce or intractable, but always refined and dignified. They are aloof with strangers and eternally loyal to loved ones. Serene and adaptable, with no special exercise needs, Chows happily take to city life.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Health issues for the Chow Chow may include eyelid entropion, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, allergies, and thyroid function. These issues may be minimized by health screening, responsible breeding, and regular health care and can be diagnosed and managed with veterinary care. Extensive and detailed information on the breed's health can be found on the website of the Chow Chow Club, Inc.","Both the rough- and smooth-coated Chows have a profuse double coat and require regular grooming. Thorough brushing at least twice per week and a monthly bath can keep the dog's skin and coat healthy. Be sure to immediately remedy any parasite issues, such as fleas or ticks. Include eye and ear care with each grooming, and trim nails regularly. Puppy coat and the coat around the head can become badly matted if not groomed regularly. Care must be taken to remove all mats and brush or comb through the undercoat. It is preferable to use a cool air dryer to thoroughly dry the Chow after a bath.","The Chow Chow is an active and alert dog with moderate exercise needs. The Chow requires daily walks and moderate play with toys, with minimal rough play or high-impact exercise. Avoid exercise during hot periods of the day, as the breed does not tolerate high heat or humidity well. A moderate-paced walk four or more times a day will help to keep Chow and owner happy and healthy, and doing activities together enhances the human-canine bond.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Chow grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. Patience and positive, consistent reinforcement are the keys to successful training. The Chow Chow is a very intelligent dog but can be stubborn. Harsh training methods are to be avoided in order to develop a trusting relationship. Patience, praise, and regular practice are the best tools to use with your Chow."

As housedogs, Cirnechi are mild, low-maintenance companions cherished for their loyal and gentle nature.
Standing under 20 inches, the Cirneco ('cheer-NEK-o'; Cirnechi is the plural) is often described as resembling a smaller version of the Pharaoh Hound, its cousin from the island of Malta. This slender but rugged hunter's coat ranges from light to dark tan or chestnut. The large, upright ears point up the alert expression of the eyes, whose amber or ochre color smartly complements the coat.



 In many ways, these lithe and leggy Sicilians are typical sighthounds: sweet-natured, independent and, of course, breathtakingly swift. It is said, though, that Cirnechi are a bit more trainable than the usual sighthound. These living artifacts of antiquity have sprinted into the 21st century relatively unchanged by passing fads and fancies.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Cirneco dell'Etna is a very hardy and healthy breed. Given excellent nutrition, regular veterinary care, parasite control, and the mental and physical stimulation he needs, he will be a happy and long-lived companion. Every week the owner should do a quick check of the dog's ears for any signs of infection, and the Cirneco's teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","The Cirneco's short-haired, smooth coat requires minimal care. Gentle weekly brushing with a soft bristle brush or hound glove should keep him looking his best, with an occasional bath only as needed. His ears should be regularly inspected for dirt or buildup of excess wax and cleaned if needed with soft gauze and an ear-cleaning solution'¿the dog's breeder or the veterinarian can recommend a good brand to use. The nails should be trimmed often if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.","Moderate physical exercise and mental stimulation are essential to satisfy the Cirneco's intensely intelligent and inquisitive nature. He does best when he has a function, whether that means competing in the show ring or other canine events or being an interactive family member. He enjoys long walks and activities with his people. Because of his strong hunting instincts, he should not be allowed off lead in areas that are not securely enclosed, as he may not be able to resist the urge to run off after perceived prey. He does well with a fenced backyard where he can enjoy playtime with his owner, although he should not be just left alone outside with no attention for long periods, as he would be lonely and unhappy.","The Cirneco has a strong, independent temperament necessary for a hunter but is friendly and affectionate and makes an excellent family pet. They respond well to gentle methods of training and can be successfully trained for obedience, rally, agility, tracking, and of course the breed's historical reason for existence: hunting. Many Cirnechi especially enjoy lure coursing. Due to the breed's strong prey drive, care must be exercised when introducing the Cirneco to cats and small animals. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Cirneco grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."

For those who can handle some shedding and drooling, the amiable Clumber is an amusing best friend and a gentlemanly housemate.
Clumber Spaniels are powerful bird dogs of heavy bone, built long and low, with a massive head. They stand 17 to 20 inches; a small female might be 55 pounds, and a large male could go 85 pounds. Built to push through thick cover in the field, Clumber movement is nonetheless free and easy. The dense coat is primarily white, with sparse lemon or orange markings.



 Clumbers are sweet and easygoing at home, but these outdoorsy fellows can be relentless on scent. Smart and eager-to-please Clumbers respond well to training. Though a bit wary around strangers, Clumbers are friendly dogs who bark only when they have something to say, and so make indifferent watchdogs. They love swimming and fetching, and are sturdy childhood playmates.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Clumbers are generally a healthy breed, although certain conditions are sometimes seen, including hypothyroidism (with side effects of skin and ear issues) and entropion or ectropion (eyelids that turn either in or out). Like many other large breeds, growing too rapidly can cause eosinophilic panosteitis in Clumber puppies'¿something they usually outgrow. Hip dysplasia also occurs in the breed. Because the Clumber body is quite long, they are also somewhat predisposed to intervertebral disc disease (cervical and thoracic). Immune mediated hemolytic anemia has been encountered in some Clumbers; all should avoid being treated with sulfa drugs.","As with all breeds with heavy, lowset ears, routine cleaning of the ears is a must to avoid ear infections. The heavy folds on the head require regular once-overs with a damp cloth. Wrinkles that are not kept dry can easily set up a yeast infection that has a bad odor and is unpleasant for the dog. Nails should be kept short with monthly trims. Bathing once a month is usually sufficient for a dog who isn't working regularly in the field. Clumbers don't require a lot of trimming; their coat is very easy care, requiring little more than a thorough grooming with a brush and a medium comb once or twice a week.","Despite their lumbering appearance, the Clumber can be a very active dog. They will benefit from long walks, taking occasional breaks to sniff around. Clumbers love to retrieve, so they can get ample exercise right in their own backyard, chasing after a tennis ball and enjoying time spent with their owner.","The Clumber is steady and reliable, thorough and tenacious. These traits can sometimes make them a challenge to train, because they tend to stop and think things through before deciding to do them. Keep training sessions interesting to keep their attention on learning instead of searching for something more fun to do. Most will require a reason to do as they are told. They do not take well to a heavy-handed trainer, however."

They were developed as hunting dogs, but Cockers gained their wide popularity as all-around companions.
Those big, dark eyes; that sweet expression; those long, lush ears that practically demand to be touched'¿no wonder the Cocker spent years as America's most popular breed. The Cocker is the AKC's smallest sporting spaniel, standing about 14 to 15 inches. The coat comes in enough colors and patterns to please any taste. The well-balanced body is sturdy and solid, and these quick, durable gundogs move with a smooth, easy gait.



 Cockers are eager playmates for kids and are easily trained as companions and athletes. They are big enough to be sporty, but compact enough to be portable. A Cocker in full coat rewards extra grooming time by being the prettiest dog on the block. These energetic sporting dogs love playtime and brisk walks.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Cocker Spaniel's national parent club, the American Spaniel Club, has a health committee that looks at breed health issues and makes recommendations to breeders for required health testing.The Cocker Spaniel has good longevity. A conscientious breeder can furnish records of the sire's and dam's health testing, for example for hips, patellas, and eyes. Breeders often have years of data regarding testing done in these health areas. Learn from the veterinarian proper procedures to clean the Cocker's ear canals on a regular basis, especially following a bath, in order to avoid infections. Thorough grooming of the Cocker coat will aid in preventing mats, which can precipitate skin problems underneath.","Cocker Spaniels require regular, thorough grooming. Sessions missed are not easily made up and may result in tangles or mats in the Cocker's coat. A metal, professional-quality dog comb with fine and medium spacing for the teeth is a necessity. You can follow combing with a gentle slicker brush, but the comb is key. Loose hair should be carefully removed with the comb, making sure you are clear and can see through to the skin everywhere. If you encounter snarls, do not pull through; rather, pick snarls apart, starting at the tips of the coat and then comb through. Be cautious when combing ears; the skin at the edges is thin and can be pierced by too-vigorous combing. The Cocker requires thorough bathing with quality dog shampoo. Thorough rinsing and re-rinsing are crucial, as soap residue can cause skin irritation. Dry carefully with a blow-dryer on not too hot a setting. Learn the procedure for cleaning and drying the ear canals. During bathing, check the Cocker's skin for any inflamed spots and get treatment. It is key to learn grooming procedures yourself and/or enlist the services of a professional groomer who likes and is experienced in grooming the breed.","The Cocker Spaniel is a sporting breed and should maintain good muscle tone, although the breed is not one that needs a lot of exercise for the purpose of discharging an abundance of energy. Cockers often enjoy getting their exercise by means of retrieving a ball or other toy, or accompanying their people on a walk. They very much enjoy spending time with their people, so walking is a good exercise option. If the Cocker has a canine companion, they can play to exercise each other. The Cocker Spaniel wants to please people and enjoys play, so these are tools you can use to encourage exercise.","Regarding training the Cocker Spaniel, the good news is that in general this is a people-pleasing breed. They want to be 'good' in order to please their people, and they are generally sensitive and responsive to correction and a disapproving tone in their owner's voice. Harsh means of correction are not usually warranted, nor are they productive in the Cocker. The breed enjoys the challenge of performance activities, and it is a good idea to try out the available activities and events to see what interests your individual Cocker and follow through with training. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Cockers are rather easily motivated with food rewards and with play and praise."

The full-coated 'rough' Collie is the more familiar variety, but there is also a sleek 'smooth' Collie.
The Collie is a large but lithe herder standing anywhere from 22 to 26 inches tall. The rough variety boasts one of the canine kingdom's most impressively showy coats; the smooth coat's charms are subtler but no less satisfying. Coat colors in both varieties are sable and white, tricolor, blue merle, or white. Collie fanciers take pride in their breed's elegant wedge-shaped head, whose mobile ears and almond eyes convey a wide variety of expressions.



 Collies are famously fond of children and make wonderful family pets. These swift, athletic dogs thrive on companionship and regular exercise. With gentle training, they learn happily and rapidly. The Collie's loyalty, intelligence, and sterling character are the stuff of legend.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Collie Health Foundation has invested lots of research dollars to identify and solve health issues, and their website offers great information on health issues in the breed. The minimum requirement is for puppies between 6-8 weeks old to have an eye check by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist for Collie eye anomaly, an inherited eye disease. Some Collies may also have a sensitivity to certain drugs, known as the MDR1 mutation. More information can be found on this at http://vcpl.vetmed.wsu.edu. Collies typically live from 12 to 14 years and are as a rule healthy, but after doing their research prospective buyers should ask questions of breeders and have an understanding of what health guarantees can be provided.","Smooth Collies, while they won't mat, require regular grooming, as they have a double coat, and the undercoat needs brushing out during shedding periods. Rough Collies need attention to avoid matting, especially in certain areas such as behind the ears and elbows, and to remove loose undercoat. A weekly brushing down to the skin eliminates that problem and keeps the coat and skin healthy. If females are spayed, they do a big shed once a year; if intact, females shed about three months after their heat cycle, and males around their birthday, so those times require a little extra grooming.","While there are variations among individuals and families, Collies generally are quite active and require regular exercise. They need aerobic exercise and the chance to be able to run and play. Teaching them to fetch can provide good exercise, and having a fenced yard where they can run and going on daily walks help too. They should not be relegated to the backyard for long periods of time, as with boredom comes barking. Collies are people dogs and want to be with their owners first and foremost. Ideally a Collie will be ready to go when it's time to go, and able to chill when it's time to chill.","While Collies are very smart and easy to train, puppy classes are recommended for general socialization and training. But it shouldn't end there. Collies love training and learning, and both make for a better companion and build a good relationship with the owner and family. Collies thrive on positive teaching methods. They excel in obedience, agility, and herding, and even barn hunt and lure coursing, and owners will discover something fun to do with their dog!"

The Coton is small but robustly sturdy.
The Coton de Tulear (KO-Tone Dih TOO-Lay-ARE) is a small, immensely charming dog standing between 9 and 11 inches high and weighing anywhere from 8 to 13 pounds. Cotons are known for a profuse white coat that is as soft as cotton (or, as the French say, 'coton'). Their primary job is to provide amusement, comfort, and companionship.



 The bond between Cotons and their people is so tight that owners discuss it in human terms. Coton fanciers describe them as 'witty' companions 'at times boisterous but never demanding' and 'naturally clownish and lighthearted,' who possess a 'remarkably gentle, sympathetic awareness.' Amusing traits of these long-lived jesters include unique vocalizations and a knack for walking on their hind legs.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Coton de Tulear has remained fairly free of genetic health issues. That is not to say that they do not exist, but that any incidences are of an extremely low percentage. In the Coton, known incidences are usually in the one- to five-percent range. Coton breeders are working diligently to keep the breed as problem free as possible by doing genetic screening of all breeding stock. Occasionally eye problems and hip dysplasia do occur in the breed. As with all small breeds, there is a chance of luxating patellas, and spinal disc disease has been known to occur.","Grooming the Coton puppy is a breeze. During that time you should groom him regularly and ensure that he learns to see grooming sessions as positive times of bonding with his person. Unless you are going to keep your Coton in a short 'puppy clip,' your dog will require a great deal of brushing. You must be careful to get your comb and brush all the way to the skin (gently) during daily brushing, or the hair next to the skin will mat and if this is too extensive your dog may need to be shaved down. You should use a spray conditioner while brushing to avoid breakage. A couple of times a week, check the ears and remove any excess hair, wax, or debris to avoid ear infections.","The Coton is a fairly active dog who requires a moderate amount of exercise. Daily walks with his human at a slow speed will keep him in good weight and condition. Chasing a tennis ball around his backyard can keep his mind active as well as his body. A bored and unhappy Coton can become destructive. He does best when provided with enough exercise, lots of attention from his owner, and plenty of interesting toys to keep him occupied.","The Coton is an alert dog and naturally territorial. Cotons should be well socialized from an early age so that they will enjoy going with you wherever you go. Obedience training is a good idea, for socialization as well as reinforcing lessons and manners. A bored Coton will be unable to learn anything. Keep your training sessions lively and entertaining for best results. Cotons respond poorly to negative training practices but will excel in most dog-sport activities when trained with positive methods. They do well in agility and obedience and make excellent therapy dogs."

He is the true master of his flock, often running through the back of the herd to get to the point of intervention as soon as possible.
Petar Horvat, the bishop of Djakovo, wrote in 1374 that Croats had brought a shepherd dog along on the move to their new land. He referred to the dog as Canis Pastoralis Croaticus'the Croatian Shepherd Dog. The bishop of Djakovo, Peter Bakic also wrote about the Croatian Sheepdog in his 1719 manuscript 'On the Life of the People and Raising of Stock in Djakovo and it's Surroundings in 1719'. He quoted the words written by Bishop Petar in 1374 and, providing his own description of the dog, stated that the Croatian Sheepdog had not changed since the record (from 1374 to 1719) and had not changed in appearance from that described by Bishop Petar in 1374. A systematic selection breeding program was started by the ""father of the breed"" - veterinarian Prof Dr Stjepan Romic in 1935 with dogs in the territory of Djakovo. After 34 years of work, the breed was recognized by the FCI in 1969.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
",The Croatian Sheepdog is an overall healthy breed.,"The Croatian Sheepdog is an easily cared for breed. Occasional baths, a combing or bushing to remove dead hair, and regular nail care is sufficient for this wash-and-wear breed.","Croatian Sheepdogs are very energetic dogs. Though they are calm and relaxed in the house, once outside they appreciate a good run. Not surprisingly, a Croatian Sheepdog excels at flyball, obedience, herding, and frisbee. They are quite playful and can be mischievous, particularly when it comes to digging. They are also noted for their extraordinary jumping ability. A well-exercised Croatian Sheepdog is a Croatian Sheepdog who tends not to find trouble elsewhere.","The Croatian is alert, energetic, intelligent, biddable, adaptable and always enthusiastic about any job that needs to be done. Needless to say, these traits make them very trainable and eager-to-please. The Croatian Sheepdog is also sensibly suspicious and, therefore, an excellent watchdog."
87,Curly-Coated-Retriever,25-27 inches (male),60-95 pounds,10-12 years,5,5,3,2,1,1,Double-Curly,Short,3,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,162 of 202,Black-Liver,,"The Curly-Coated Retriever, among the oldest of the retriever breeds, is a famously versatile gundog and peerless swimmer. Poised, proud, and wickedly smart, the Curly is a thinking person's retriever who will never quit before you do.
The Curly-Coated Retriever's tight, crisp curls of either black or liver serve as waterproof and thorn-resistant all-weather gear for work in thick bramble and icy lakes. The Curly is a big, durable gun dog, but more elegant and graceful than other retrievers. Another trait that sets Curlies apart from the usual retriever is a tapered, wedge-shaped head.



 Like Labradors and Goldens, Curlies are affectionate and gentle, but they are a bit more independent and less needy. Playful and mischievous with loved ones, Curlies can be aloof with strangers. This wariness makes them more discerning watchdogs than other, more gregarious retrievers. These tireless dogs need lots of outdoor exercise. Bored, underemployed Curlies are a handful.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The majority of Curlies are a healthy breed. Breeders have been very diligent about screening hips, eyes, and the heart. There are some cancer concerns. The breed is also susceptible to gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), a life-threatening stomach condition also known as bloat. Owners must be aware of the symptoms and take quick action if it occurs.","Curlies do not have an undercoat, and the females will usually shed a fair amount of coat approximately every six months. Females may look relatively bare when not in coat. During shedding season a rake-type grooming tool with metal prongs is good at removing the dead hair, then the coat can be scissored down. The majority of owners never brush a Curly-Coated Retriever, as then the coat frizzes. A wet-down and air-dry is easy to do and often will enhance the curls. The breed does not need to be bathed frequently. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly.","Curlies do need a fair amount of exercise but are also wonderful about settling down and relaxing at home. Their home does not need to be a large one as long as they are with their owner and have adequate exercise. The breed is very easy to live with as long as they have been shown their ""good manners"" with basic training. They love to be outside, yet they are very happy to spend time indoors at home with their people. They are not a breed who is good at being left alone for long periods of time.","The owner of a Curly-Coated Retriever needs to be firm but kind in training of the dog. Too rough, and they will turn tail; too soft or unclear, and they will not pay attention. They are an intelligent breed and smart enough to need an owner who is smarter than they are. Two things are helpful to remember regarding training a Curly: First, avoid too much repetition, as the dog may become bored and lose interest. Also, it is important for an owner to try to make the learning situation as much fun as possible. The goal is to make it so that the Curly enjoys what is being taught. Some Curlies do very well in the obedience ring, but for some the repetition of some of the exercises can cause disinterest. Training for fieldwork takes a knowledgeable approach and should not be rough. When new to the breed and interested in starting field training, find a training group in your area with whom you can train, and observe their methods before deciding to join."
88,Czechoslovakian-Vlcak,Minimum: 23.5-25.5 inches,Minimum: 44-57 pounds,10-15 years,3,1,1,5,2,3,Double-Wavy,Medium,3,3,5,2,3,3,3,3,,Gray-Silver Gray-Yellow Gray,,"An alert, primitive canine that resembles a wolf in appearance. They are highly intelligent, powerful, active, loyal and devoted to it's owner. They have superior eyesight, hearing and sense of smell and are known for having excellent stamina and endurance.
The Czechoslovakian Vlcak (CSV) was originally bred for working border patrol in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s. They are currently used in Europe and the United States for search and rescue, tracking, obedience, agility, drafting, herding, and working dog sports. The CSV is bred for versatility and hardiness in harsh elements and is much more independent in nature than many other working breeds. They are an excellent choice for tracking or trailing sport/work, or as a companion for active owners who enjoy spending time doing outdoor activities such as biking, running, or hiking. They are not, however, recommended for first time owners.

",Czechoslovakian Vlcaks are a very healthy and robust breed. It is wise to ask the breeder what health concerns they have seen in each genetic line.,"Czechoslovakian Vlcaks have a weather resistant coat; it naturally cleans itself of mud and dirt. They seldom need a bath and have little to no body odor. They shed twice-a-year and at that time daily brushing is required. The winter coat is thicker, heavier and longer than the shorter, thinner summer coat and this may require more grooming during the colder months of the year. Their strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","This breed is known for having boundless energy, especially during puppyhood and young adolescence. Daily long walks/runs combined with mental stimulation work well. Turning them out into the back yard by themselves does not work. A Vlcak does best when they have a 'meaningful' job they can devote themselves to. They like to have an interactive experience with their owners. Activities like swimming, hiking, retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. A CSV may have prey drive towards small animals, so fenced enclosures and/or on-leash are always a good idea.","The Czechoslovakian Vlcak is a primitive breed of dog with a dominant and independent personality and so requires a different approach to training. Consistency and patience is a must. The CSV is confident, lively, active, high stamina, high energy, tough and obedient with quick reactions. They are also highly intelligent, versatile and curious. Early socialization and training is very important. With proper training, Vlcaks can excel in many different types of activities, but they need to see a purpose for the desired task. They bore very easily, do not like to do repetitive tasks and often refuse to perform the tasks regardless of treat incentives. Positive reinforcement training methods are highly recommended. The Czechoslovakian Vlcak is not recommended for first time owners as they need strong pack leadership and structure."
89,Dachshund,8-9 inches (standard),16-32 pounds (standard),12-16 years,5,3,4,2,2,2,Smooth,Short-Medium,4,4,4,4,4,3,5,3,12 of 202,Black-Black & Cream-Black & Tan-Blue & Tan-Chocolate-Chocolate & Tan-Cream-Fawn-Red-Wheaten-Wild Boar-Blue & Cream-Fawn (Isabella) & Tan-Fawn (Isabella) & Cream-Chocolate & Cream,Brindle-Sable-Piebald-Dapple-Double Dapple-Brindle Piebald,"The famously long, low silhouette, ever-alert expression, and bold, vivacious personality of the Dachshund have made him a superstar of the canine kingdom. Dachshunds come in two sizes and in three coat types of various colors and patterns.
The word 'icon' is terribly overworked, but the Dachshund'¿with his unmistakable long-backed body, little legs, and big personality'¿is truly an icon of purebred dogdom. Dachshunds can be standard-sized (usually 16 to 32 pounds) or miniature (11 pounds or under), and come in one of three coat types: smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired.



 Dachshunds aren't built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything. Smart and vigilant, with a big-dog bark, they make fine watchdogs. Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey, they can be brave to the point of rashness, and a bit stubborn, but their endearing nature and unique look has won millions of hearts the world over.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Generally a healthy breed, the Dachshund can be expected to live 12 to 16 years with proper care, so long as he's kept on a good diet and has enough exercise to maintain good muscle tone. To prevent disc damage to the Dachshund's long back, be vigilant about keeping him from becoming overweight, and always monitor his activities to avoid back injury. Like most dogs with drop ears, Dachshunds can get ear infections if their ears aren't kept clean.","Dachshunds are moderate shedders, relatively clean, and have little or no body odor. The breed's grooming needs vary with the three coat types. Smooth-coated Dachshunds are somewhat 'wash and wear,' needing little beyond a wipe with a towel or hound glove to look dapper. Longhaired Dachshunds may require more frequent brushing, depending on the thickness of the coat. The Wirehaired coat can be plucked or hand-stripped several times a year to look its best, but beyond that is easy to maintain between groomings with occasional trimming of the beard and eyebrows and brushing or combing once or twice a week. All Dachshunds should have their nails trimmed every month.","Many owners think that because they are so small, Dachshunds don't require more exercise than just running around the house. However, they do need regular exercise not only to stay fit, but also to build strong muscles to support and protect their back. Two walks every day of moderate length should be sufficient. To avoid injury, never allow your Dachshund to run up and down stairs or jump on or off furniture. Because they are very social, Dachshunds don't do well as outdoor dogs'¿they want to be with their humans.","Dachshunds are very intelligent but are also independent and often stubborn, so they can be a challenge to train. They love to give and receive affection and do best with positive, reward-based training. They are sensitive and will not react well to harsh commands or punishment. Patience and consistence are key. Dachshunds have an excellent sense of smell as well as a strong prey drive. Because they were bred to stay focused and follow a trail without distraction, if they are busy with something more interesting they may not always pay attention to you."
90,Dalmatian,19-24 inches,45-70 pounds,11-13 years,5,3,3,4,2,2,Smooth,Short,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,56 of 202,"White & Black-White & Lemon-White & Orange-White Black & Tan-White & Liver Brown-White, Liver & Tan",,"The dignified Dalmatian, dogdom's citizen of the world, is famed for his spotted coat and unique job description. During their long history, these ""coach dogs"" have accompanied the horse-drawn rigs of nobles, gypsies, and firefighters.
The Dalmatian's delightful, eye-catching spots of black or liver adorn one of the most distinctive coats in the animal kingdom. Beneath the spots is a graceful, elegantly proportioned trotting dog standing between 19 and 23 inches at the shoulder. Dals are muscular, built to go the distance; the powerful hindquarters provide the drive behind the smooth, effortless gait.



 The Dal was originally bred to guard horses and coaches, and some of the old protective instinct remains. Reserved and dignified, Dals can be aloof with strangers and are dependable watchdogs. With their preferred humans, Dals are bright, loyal, and loving house dogs. They are strong, active athletes with great stamina'¿a wonderful partner for runners and hikers.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","If your Dalmatian came from a reputable breeder, you will have a record of genetic health testing done on the parents. Deafness is present in the breed, and responsible breeders will have had the parents tested and will have entire litters tested to be certain that all can hear. A unilaterally hearing dog (deaf in one ear) can usually lead a fairly normal life; a bilaterally (both sides) deaf dog often cannot and will require special considerations. Kidney stones are also present in Dals. Your breeder or vet can tell you what you should feed to avoid the problem. Usually quite healthy, Dalmatians aren't picky eaters and don't require a lot of supplements to keep them looking fit.","The Dalmatian's coat is a thing of beauty with its colored spots on a sparkling white background, and it doesn't take much work to keep it in good condition. Occasional baths and weekly brushing with a horsehair mitt or rubber curry comb to pull away dead hairs will keep the Dal looking his best. His nails should be trimmed at least monthly. Because his ears flop down, they should be checked regularly'¿your breeder and your veterinarian can suggest a good routine and cleaning materials, and will show you how to care for them.","All Dalmatians need regular exercise to stay fit and happy. This exercise can consist of chasing a ball tossed across the backyard, running alongside a biking or jogging owner, or taking a nice, long hike through the woods. Since a puppy's bones and joints aren't at their mature strength until two years of age, be wary of strenuously exercising the dog before then. Dalmatians can be very high-energy dogs and can easily get into mischief if they don't have enough opportunity for physical and mental exercise.","It is very important that you expose your puppy to as many new and unusual but pleasant situations as possible as part of his training. If he understands that new places and people are nothing to be afraid of, it will not only make his life happier but will make life with him much easier for you. He should be taught to behave from the very beginning, but Dalmatians can be very sensitive, so positive, reward-based training is a must. Early socialization and puppy training classes will help to ensure that your Dal grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."
91,Dandie-Dinmont-Terrier,8-11 inches,18-24 pounds,12-15 years,4,3,3,2,3,1,Double,Medium,4,3,4,3,4,3,3,3,176 of 202,Mustard-Pepper,,"The unique-looking Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a tough but dignified little exterminator. Sturdily built for the rigors of farm life, they will agreeably adapt to city living. Dandies are compact companions blessed with a big personality.
Physical hallmarks of the Dandie Dinmont Terrier include a large head covered with profuse, silky white hair; long, hanging ears tipped with feathering and coming almost to a point; big, round eyes full of brightness and expression; and a long, low torso and short legs. The crisp body coat comes in two spicy colors: pepper (bluish black to silvery gray) and mustard (reddish brown to pale fawn).



 Weighing no more than 24 pounds, Dandies are alert and intelligent watchdogs with a big baritone bark. Dandies enjoy romping and cuddling with kids, but aren't as hyper as some small dogs. They are terriers, though, with typical willfulness, independence, and courage. Dandie owners get best results with positive, motivational training.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","There is no breed that is completely disease free, but a Dandie comes closer than many others. A rare few develop lymphoma, but otherwise the breed is typically quite healthy. Responsible breeders do genetic testing on their breeding stock to avoid any potential problems. As with all breeds, a Dandie's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","The Dandie Dinmont Terrier does not shed, but that doesn't mean he requires no grooming. His coat must be stripped of dead hair at least a couple of times a year. This can be done by hand by his breeder, or the owner can learn to do it using a special stripping tool recommended by the breeder. Long hairs can be plucked daily from the coat using thumb and forefinger to maintain a neat appearance. The Dandie will also need to be brushed daily to avoid matting Toenails should be trimmed at least monthly, and care of the ears should be included in maintenance grooming.","A Dandie will do best exercising a half hour or so twice a day in the form of a brisk walk, or perhaps chasing a ball across the yard. When outdoors he should always be on a leash or in a securely fenced area. The Dandie was bred to hunt, and even the best trained will dart away given the chance to chase what they perceive as prey. Most Dandies will do very well in a home environment with moderate exercise. With their long-and-low build, Dandies are not made to run long distances, and the breed is not the ideal fit for owners looking for a jogging or biking partner.","Dandies are tough but dignified big dogs in a little body. With lots of patience and a positive reward-based approach you will get wonderful results. They are 'rough-and-tumble,' sturdy little dogs with lots of energy but are very adaptable and eager to please. Typical terriers, they can be stubborn, independent, and a little too sure of their ability to take on all comers. It is imperative that you train the Dandie well so that you not only have a companion with good manners, but also that you can take the lead in unexpected situations."

The body is stocky and close to the ground, but Dogues can move like lions when duty calls.



 DDBs of proper temperament are sweet and sensitive souls. Owners appreciate their breed's loyalty to loved ones of all ages, but also say DDBs can be stubborn and will dominate those who fail to apply firm training in puppyhood. When acquiring such a strapping super-dog, finding a responsible breeder is key.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Bloat, or gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV), is a serious concern in the Dogue de Bordeaux. Owners should educate themselves to recognize the signs that bloat could be happening, and know what actions to take if so. Heart disease, cancer, orthopedic issues (such as hips and elbows), and epilepsy are also issues of concern in the breed. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for conditions the breed can be prone to. As with all breeds, a Dogue de Bordeaux's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often.","The breed is well-known for how much they drool, and the wrinkles on their facial area need special attention at least weekly, sometimes daily, to see that they are kept clean and dry. At least once a week it's also important to clean the ears and check for debris or signs of infection. nails should be trimmed monthly. The Dogue de Bordeaux should get a full bath every four weeks or so. In between baths, wiping him down with a damp towel can keep him looking and smelling great. The breed's short coat will shed year '¿round; using a rubber curry or a shedding blade can keep the loose hair that falls to the floor to a minimum.","To avoid strain on developing bones and joints, the young Bordeaux should be limited to low-impact exercise until at least 18 months of age. They should not be overexerted and should not be allowed to run up and down stairs or jump off of surfaces higher than their back. Swimming is an excellent exercise for Bordeaux of any age. An older Bordeaux can work more strenuously, including doing jobs such as pulling carts.","Socialization and early obedience training are an absolute must. The Dogue de Bordeaux is a sensitive breed who requires trust, and a rough trainer or heavy-handed approach should be avoided. Discipline should be firm and consistent without being harsh; ownership of the breed is not for the timid or the very busy person."
97,Drentsche-Patrijshond,,,11-14 years,3,5,5,3,3,1,,Medium,3,3,1,3,5,3,1,5,,White,Brown Markings,"This breed is pronounced da'rinse-ah puh'trice-hoon. The Drentsche Patrijshond, Drent for short, is not your typical continental pointer. For starters, the Drent has a tail and is nearly four hundred years old. The Drent was built by farmers for farmers. As a farm dog, Drents had to do it all: hunt feather and fur, keep the farm clear of vermin, cart dairy to the market and much more. The breed has maintained versatility from the beginning and are highly intelligent and adaptable. As such, training must be kept lively and interesting. Drents are used in all types of hunting, agility, tracking, dog sledding, and skijoring.
The breed developed from pointing dogs originating in Spain (Spioenen) and arrived in The Netherlands via France in the 16th Century. In The Netherlands, these dogs were referred to as Partridge dogs. In the Province of Drenthe, these Partridge dogs were bred among themselves and not mixed with foreign breeds, as occurred elsewhere. Throughout the Drent¿s history, the breed stood on three equally important pillars: versatile hunting dog, farmyard dog, and playmate to the children. It is fundamental to the Drent breed that he hunts all upland game and waterfowl, announces visitors to the home or farm (without showing aggression or fear), and is an excellent family companion.


The Drent is used to hunt a variety of terrain and game. His adaptability makes him suitable for all manner of game in the field as well as waterfowl. Moreover, his work after the shot is exceptional, and he is a good retriever. These characteristics are innate, and the dog therefore needs little field training. Due to the dog's soft nature forceful training methods are inappropriate. The dog is expected to bark to announce visitors to the home and is often reserved towards strangers until the owner welcomes them, meaning the Drent may be shy in the beginning but never fearful. The dog is loyal and intelligent and, with proper upbringing, a pet of exceptional value on top of being a good hunting buddy.

They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","In broad strokes, the Drent is a healthy breed. Certainly, some individuals may suffer from any canine malady, but that isn't representative across the breed as a common issue or health concern.


From a genetic standpoint, the Drent has only a few hereditary diseases to know about and monitor in order to keep incidences low. The Drent's eyes should be monitored for the following hereditary diseases: Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), Distichiasis, Entropion and Ectropion, Persistent Pupillay Membranes (PPM), and Retinal Dysplasisa.


Other diseases or abnormalities which have been found in the Drent are: The most common, but usually non-problematic, is von Willebrand disease type-I (vWD-I). Despite a high incidence rate of carriers and affected dogs in the population. To date there have been no Drents that have shown clinical sign of the disease. This means affected dogs (dogs with two copies of the gene), do not have an abnormal bleeding response. Von Willebrand disease type-I is detectable by DNA health panels. While the disease is of interest, it is not considered to be a threat for the Drent.


Amongst breed authorities, Epilepsy is considered to be the greatest current health threat to the Drent. The type of Epilepsy has not been determined. There are a several research projects underway, no results have been produced to date. There is no genetic testing available for this in the Drent. Occurrence/manifestation is uncommon.


Other health issues that can be present: hypothyroidism, cryptorchidism, hyperuricosuria, significant reactions to poisonous insect bites/stings and the absence of certain teeth. Like many breeds, hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia should be monitored and all breeding stock screened for. Joint dysplasia is influenced by genetics and environment, so using care during the Drents' rapid growth period is advisable.","The coat of the Drent is considered the be 'half-long', meaning hair on the body is short of a full curl to nearly flat, but has feathering on the neck, back of all legs, and a brushy tail. Drents have a single coat, similar to a Field-Line Setter or Brittany and shed twice per year.


Usually, a weekly grooming session will handle everything well, and prevent your Drent from needing to be bathed, unless of course they get into something odorous. The Drent¿s coat is not oily or sebaceous and their coat texture is fine, so the regular brushing serves to keep them dirt and dander free. The ear it the most difficult part of Drent maintenance. You should be prepared to strip off overgrowth so that the natural shape of the ear leather is easy to see. Check ears and nails weekly.


Managing the seasonal change  is generally handled with ease with the proper use of a Mars coat rake, a comb, followed by a pin brush, finished with a boar bristle brush to polish up the coat.","Drents are intelligent hunting dogs in need of stimulation and regular exercise, regardless of the weather. They are wonderful hiking partners, but also suitable for canicross, or any of the 'joring' sports. The Drent also would be good for agility, or other 'action' sport where mind and body are engaged. This breed is not suitable for sedentary lifestyles.","Drents are intelligent hunting dogs in need of mental stimulation and regular exercise, regardless of the weather.

They have a proud carriage, well-developed muscles and agile appearance. Affectionate, playful, and sweet, the Drever gets along well with most other breeds and is great in groups.
The Drever was developed in the early twentieth century in Sweden. Hunting deer was difficult due to terrain and herd locations so hunters soon realized the benefits of using this short-legged, long-bodied dog to drive the deer over long distances and rough terrain right to them. A keen and even-tempered hound, the Drever is never aggressive, nervous or shy. They are content in most living situations, but tend to be vocal when alerting or at play.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Some dogs may be faced with health challenges in their lives, but the majority of Drevers are healthy, sound dogs. Working with a responsible breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed.","A Drever's short, coarse hair is easily maintained. Though they do shed some, this dog is truly a ""wash-n-wear"" breed. The occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. If necessary, nails can be trimmed with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth can be brushed.","Drevers are a very playful breed and love to hang out with their people. As long as they have some stimulating daily activity, they are also content to lay on the couch with you. They are great companions for outdoor activities like walking, biking, and hiking and are happiest with a good balanced routine. Any activity to stimulate their hunting abilities and scent work is greatly enjoyed by the Drever, as they are excellent hunters. Other activities to expend the Drever's energy could include Barn Hunting, Wounded Animal Recon, Shed Hunting, Lure Coursing, Rally, and Agility.","Drevers are hunters and they will most definitely follow their nose, so training to listen to commands is a must. Though gentle and loving, as a hound, Drevers can still be stubborn, so there must be a commitment to his training"

Having an independent nature, it can be slightly obstinate and have a mind of its own. Since its original duties were to keep flocks of sheep in a particular location, it is able to run all day, and that is reflected in its physique and structure.
The Dutch Shepherd was discovered as a naturally occurring shepherd's dog living in rural areas. It was developed as an all-purpose farm dog, working originally as a farm guard, drover, and livestock dog. A well known dog fancier wrote about the Dutch Shepherd in 1910: ""...bearing a great resemblance to the wolf."" Of course this is not entirely true, but it is another aspect that shows that the Dutch Shepherd still has many of the characteristics of its wild forebears. Although it is not a widely known breed, the Dutch Shepherd is a loyal companion and competent working dog used for obedience, dog sports, herding, tracking, search and rescue, and as a police dog.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Being a lesser known breed and because of Dutch breeding rules, the Dutch Shepherd is generally a healthy breed. As with any breed, there are sometimes occurrences of other diseases. Current testing is underway to determine if there is a need for other required tests. Breeders should screen for hip dysplasia in all coat types. The long-haired types should also be screened for thyroid issues, and the rough-haired for goniodysplasia.","The Dutch Shepherd's coat can be a gold brindle or a silver brindle. There are also three coat types: short-hair, long-hair and rough-hair. The short-hair types will only need occasional brushing. Switch to daily brushing during the seasonal shedding periods in the Spring and Fall. The longhaired dogs will need to be groomed about once per week, or more often than that if their work level and environment requires it. The rough-hair types require a combing once per month and the coat is hand-stripped twice per year.



 Bathing can be done as-needed. Their nails can be trimmed, if necessary, with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed.","Originally bred as an all-purpose farm dog, the Dutch Shepherd has also excelled as a police and military dog. As such, it has been bred for hard work, and plenty of it. Driven to do its chosen work, this dog will differentiate between work, play, and chill time, adjusting its energy level accordingly. This breed does not want to be a pet left at home; they want to be your partner in life. Provided with proper mental and physical exercise, this dog makes a great pet for an active family familiar with dogs.","A very intelligent breed that loves a challenge, the Dutch Shepherd is prepared to be obedient. Because of their keen intelligence, this breed does better with shorter training sessions (with little repetitions), and they become more driven as the work becomes more mentally stimulating. Without training, this breed will become very independent and will start to make its own decisions, so obedience training is highly recommended. Gifted with the true shepherd temperament, this breed excels in many different fields including but not limited to, herding, scent detection, scent tracking, IPO, obedience, and agility."

These include progressive retinal atrophy, hip dysplasia, familial nephropathy, and adult onset neuropathy. A responsible breeders will have their breeding stock tested for conditions that can affect the breed. The English Cocker's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","Most English Cockers have a fairly profuse coat that requires regular care, including a thorough brushing and combing at least once a week to keep the dog looking his best and to prevent the formation of mats and tangles. In addition the dog is usually trimmed every month or so in certain areas'¿around the feet, on the face, under the neck, on the underside of the ears, and under the tail. The owner can learn to use scissors, thinning shears or a stripping tool, and clippers to do an overall trim and help keep up the English Cocker's neat appearance. The ears should be checked weekly for debris and excess wax, and the nails should be trimmed at least monthly.","An upbeat, active sporting dog, the English Cocker Spaniel requires daily exercise for his physical and mental well-being. He will do well with activities such as long walks or hikes with his owner or playing ball in the backyard. As his hunting instincts remain strong, he should be on a leash for walks, and a fenced yard is recommended. Merry and affectionate, the English Cocker Spaniel is an excellent family companion and easy to train. Whether he is working in the field or at home lounging on the sofa, his tail rarely stops wagging.","With a merry, devoted disposition, the English Cocker was developed to follow instructions in the field, and the breed is still very eager to please. He is easy to train and enjoys working with his person so long as only positive methods are used. The EC will react poorly to a harsh or negative training approach; he must love and respect his person, never fear them. Early socialization is recommended to ensure a well-adjusted companion who is adaptable to a variety of situations."

 These pack-oriented, scent-driven hounds are gentle and sociable, but rarely seen as house pets. They can be so driven by a primal instinct for pursuit that not much else, including training, matters to them.

A weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush or a hound glove will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best, and an occasional bath (using a gentle shampoo) can help keep him from having a doggy odor. The ears should be regularly inspected and cleaned if needed with soft gauze and an ear-cleaning solution'¿the dog's breeder or the veterinarian can recommend a good brand to use. The nails should be trimmed often if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort and problems walking and running.","The English Foxhound is an easygoing dog but does need plenty of daily exercise and outdoor activity. The breed is a good one for an active family with plenty of acreage. English Foxhounds are not recommended for city or apartment living, as their space will be too confined. They are high-energy dogs, but with the proper amount of exercise, they are gentle, social, and relaxed indoors. Since they are bred to run for miles, they can make good hiking and running companions. Daily long, brisk walks are important for this breed. As scent hounds, they may want to run off and explore an interesting scent, so it is important to keep the dog on leash unless in a safely enclosed area. The breed can participate in obedience, tracking, agility, coursing ability tests, rally, and other canine sports and activities.","Like many other hounds, English Foxhounds generally have an independent nature and can be stubborn. Training takes consistency, patience, and an understanding of scent hound temperament. They respond well to calm, loving, but firm leadership and are willing and able to be obedient once the pack order is established.

Ideally this could be a daily vigorous run or play session in a large, securely fenced area. Many owners don't have access to such an area, however, so they may ride a bicycle with their English Setter alongside on a leash, jog with him, or take him for long walks or hikes. Because their bones and joints may not reach mature strength until two years of age, it's best to avoid very strenuous or high-impact activity with puppies and young dogs. Even though they are energetic athletes when outdoors, English Setters will usually settle right down as quiet companions in the home after their daily run or walk.","English Setters are sensible, good-natured, and devoted companions. They are very sensitive and take reprimands to heart, so it's best to teach them with positive reinforcement rather than punishment.

They are smart but can be stubborn during training; patience, consistency, and a positive, gentle approach are keys to success. Harsh methods are never appropriate for this sensitive, trusting breed. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Charlie grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."

These spirited, energetic workers and athletes are independent problem solvers and are happiest with a job to perform.
Entlebucher (ENT-leh-boo-cur) Mountain Dogs are muscular, long-backed cattle dogs standing from 16 to 21 inches at the shoulder. They have short, sturdy legs; a striking black, white, and tan coat; and an attentive, friendly face. Entles are famous for their agility, balance, and boundless enthusiasm.



 Entles are vigilant protectors of their four- or two-legged 'herds' and, when properly socialized, make durable and trustworthy playmates for older kids. Energetic Entles require lots of exercise, family time, and direction to reach their full potential. Inexperienced owners might be overwhelmed by this strong, self-confident, go-go herding dog eager for work.



 Entlebuchers are fine dogs'¿clever, zesty, happy'¿but not for everyone.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Most Entlebuchers are healthy dogs, but there are a few disorders the breed can be prone to. One issue found in the breed is Entlebucher urinary syndrome, a condition involving the misplacement of the ureter. Other conditions that have occurred in the breed include hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and some eye disorders. Responsible breeders screen for genetic disease and select for health-cleared stock.","The Entlebucher requires minimal grooming overall. With their dense, short, shiny double coat, they will need little more than a wipe-down with a damp towel between baths to stay in optimum appearance. The breed sheds quite a bit, so you may want to invest in a good stripping comb or a thick bristle brush to keep shedding to a minimum. Nails should be trimmed every month to keep them short and neat. Dental care should be started early and maintained on a regular basis throughout your dog's life. Ears should be checked weekly. Cleaning out wax and debris can help avoid the ear infections that plague dogs with drop ears.","The Entlebucher Mountain Dog is a quick and tough dog with a high energy level. It will take at least an hour of exercise daily to keep him in good physical condition. Since a 'tired dog is a good dog,' keeping the breed's energy channeled through exercise will make training and simply living with him much easier. Entles love doing things with their owners so make excellent companions for runners, hikers, bikers, and other very active people.","Entles are smart, versatile workers who are very rewarding to train. Training with a positive approach will almost always yield quick and successful results. Early socialization is extremely important with this breed. They are very intelligent, so any training routine should include fun and variety to keep them from getting bored. They love having a job to do and are excellent candidates for obedience, tracking, agility, herding and almost any other canine sport."
106,Estrela-Mountain-Dog,24.5-29 inches,77-132 pounds,10-14 years,5,5,3,3,2,4,Double-Wavy,Long,2,3,5,3,4,3,3,3,,Brindle-Fawn-Wolfgray-Yellow,White Markings-Black Mask,"The Estrela Mountain Dog is not only an excellent livestock guardian, but is also known for his love of children and family. Proper socialization and training as a puppy is very important so that the dominance in the Estrela's personality does not become aggressive.
The Estrela Mountain Dog is named for the Estrela Mountains in Portugal and is believed to be the oldest breed in the region. The breed has several distinctive physical characteristics including rosed ears, a black mask and a hook at the end of its tail. He is an inseparable companion of the shepherd and a faithful flock guardian, bravely protecting it against predators and thieves. A wonderful farm and house guard, he is distrustful towards strangers but typically docile to his master.



 As a companion in the home, an Estrela will bond for life. He will love and protect his whole family, but a piece of his soul will belong to that one special family member of his choosing. As an Estrela owner tells us: ""There is nothing compared to the love of an Estrela.""

Good breeders utilize genetic testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies","The Estrela has a thick outer coat that resembles the texture of goat hair and comes in longhair and shorthair varieties. Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your pet. Their strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Estrela is a relatively calm breed, but with children he knows and especially as a puppy, he can be quite playful. If not a working dog, options for exercise could include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or taken for daily walks. In inclement weather, indoor activities like chasing a ball rolled along the floor or teaching him new tricks can be good ways to expend energy. This breed, as indicated by his past, needs space and freedom to roam and is not suitable for apartment living. If not given adequate stimulation, he will become destructive in the home. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise and mental stimulation.",

Confident, calm, and well-balanced, he is loyal to the entire family, but reserved towards strangers. He must live in close contact with his family, as he is not suited to be kept in kennels or tied up outside.
The Eurasier comes in a beautiful array of colors. All coat colors are permitted as per the breed standard except for liver color, pure white and irregular white patches. Eurasiers can have purple tongues, pink tongues or spotted tongues. They can also have dark face masks or light, so-called reverse masks. Eurasiers are calm, even-tempered, gentle, loving, intelligent and confident.

","Eurasiers were bred to be robust and sturdy. In general, they are a healthy breed. Breeding is subject to thorough testing to minimize health problems. Diseases that can occur in the breed are hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, distichiasis, thyroid conditions, EPI, and gastric torsion. The parent club requires health testing of all breeding dogs prior to mating and encourages testing of offspring to gain as much health information as possible on the breed.","To keep them clean and happy, Eurasiers need a once-a-week to bi-weekly thorough combing/brushing with body checks for burrs or pests; a cleaning of their eyes, ears and a check of their pads; and occasional nail clippings, if needed (especially their dewclaws).They have little body odor and require infrequent bathing. Typically, Eurasiers shed their entire undercoat once or twice a year for a period of about 3 weeks. During undercoat shedding periods, daily combings/brushings are required to minimize picking up 'wool' balls from around the house. If Eurasiers are spayed or neutered their coats can become much thicker, longer and harder to manage.","Eurasiers should have good daily walks and active play with other dogs. Off-leash walks are preferred once trained and reliable to recall. Some Eurasiers like to swim and others enjoy agility or obedience. Some also work as therapy dogs. While they are calm in the house, they are active and energetic while outside.","Eurasiers are good-natured, but can be reserved towards strangers. This can be largely overcome with proper socialization. They are very loyal to their family, willing-to-please and good to train, although they can show some independence. The Eurasier is a sensitive dog that does not require harsh reprisals; rather, gentle affection, love and understanding provide its incentive to learn. Training must be interesting for the dog and not repetitive as he gets easily bored. The Eurasier is a very social dog that must be included as part of the family. Typically Eurasiers are non-confrontational and will only defend themselves when they absolutely need to."
108,Field-Spaniel,18 inches (male),35-50 pounds,12-13 years,5,5,4,3,2,2,Smooth-Wavy,Medium,4,3,3,4,5,3,3,3,149 of 202,Black-Black & Tan-Black & White-Blue Roan-Blue Roan & Tan-Golden Liver-Golden Liver Roan-Liver-Liver & Tan-Liver & White-Liver Roan,Tan Markings,"The sweet and sensitive Field Spaniel is famously docile, but vigorous and game for anything when at play or in the field. These close cousins to Cocker Spaniels and Springer Spaniels may be small in number, but their charm is enormous.
Field Spaniels bear a family resemblance to Cocker, Springer, and Sussex spaniels. The distinctive glossy coat is either black, some shade of liver, or combinations of the two. They stand 17 or 18 inches at the shoulder and should present the picture of well-balanced, moderately proportioned hunting companions. The long, feathery ears frame a facial expression conveying a grave, gentle intelligence.



 Field Spaniels are sweet, sensitive souls with just enough independence to make life interesting. They are trustworthy with kids, tolerant of their fellow mammals, and responsive to training. The U.S. breed standard calls these tranquil house dogs 'unusually docile,' but they are nonetheless playful and enjoy a good backyard romp.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","A generally healthy breed, Field Spaniels have seen some issues that also affect other breeds. Responsible breeders screen for genetic disease and select for health-cleared stock. Breeders are urged to adhere to recommended testing and consider orthopedics, thyroid, eyes, cardiac, and late-onset seizures when planning matings.Temperament, structure, and health are all very important in making up this breed that is a ""combination of beauty and utility"" in an enthusiastic canine companion.","The lovely single coat is one of the breed's most attractive features but requires regular care and maintenance. Weekly brushing and combing will keep the coat shiny and help to reduce shedding. Fields may need minimal trimming about the head and feet. The breed is not to be body clipped as some other spaniels. Their ears should be checked regularly for any signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","An active sporting breed, the Field possesses an energetic spirit that does best with regular exercise and mental stimulation. They are suitable for many canine sports and activities and enjoy brisk activity, as well as downtime at home with their families. Fields are found in a wide variety of lifestyles, from city to country, but do best when given challenges for both the mind and body.","The Field Spaniel is an intelligent problem-solver who is trainable and can excel at any game when properly motivated. These ""thinking dogs"" thrive best on clear communication and reward, with minimal correction. They require early socialization and a family sensitive to their needs. Fields love their people and range from serious to clownish in attitude. Once they understand expectations, they are solid in training, and the breed excels in multiple canine sports and activities. Fields are an amazing, soft breed that are not for everyone, but owners feel their sometimes-oafish habits such as snoring, sloppy drinking, and perpetually shedding coats are well worth their companionship."
109,Finnish-Lapphund,18-21 inches (male),33-53 pounds,12-15 years,5,4,3,4,2,2,Double,Medium,4,3,3,4,4,3,5,3,161 of 202,Black-Blue-Brindle-Brown-Cream-Tan-Wolf Sable-Saddle-Blonde,"White Markings-Tan Points-Black Mask-Tri Color Markings-Piebald-Domino-White Markings, Black Mask-White & Tan Markings-Tan Points & Ticked","The weatherproof Finnish Lapphund is a tough and substantial reindeer herder from north of the Arctic Circle. This remarkably empathetic breed is among the friendliest of all dogs'¿once he's satisfied that you aren't a reindeer rustler.
Finnish Lapphunds, with their luscious coat, sweet spitz-like face, and profusely coated tail that curves over the back, are instantly recognizable as Nordic dogs. Lappies stand about 20 inches at the shoulder and are surprisingly muscular and substantial for their inches. Quick and agile, they move effortlessly and can go from a trot to a full gallop in a second flat.



 Lappies are friendly and submissive companions, though a bit wary of strangers. They crave companionship and will be miserable when neglected. A distinctive breed trait is a strong 'startle reflex,' the result of centuries spent ducking the antlers of ornery reindeer. Despite their propensity for shedding and barking, Lappies are popular pets in their homeland.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Finnish Lapphunds are generally healthy dogs, but there are a few conditions the breed is prone to. Two of these are elbow and hip dysplasia, both of which can be detected with X-rays. Also present in some Lappies is progressive retinal atrophy, which causes vision loss. Responsible breeders check their breeding stock for conditions that can affect the breed. As with all breeds, a Lappy's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often.","The Finnish Lapphund has a double coat: a smooth outer coat over a soft, dense undercoat. Weekly brushing'¿daily during shedding season'¿will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Lappies don't have a doggie odor, so an occasional bath is usually sufficient. Lappies should never be shaved, as it reduces their ability to keep cool in warm weather and warm in cold weather. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","Finnish Lapphunds are calm dogs with moderate exercise requirements. A long, brisk walk every day is usually enough to keep the breed healthy and happy. Lappies tend not to exercise themselves, but a half-hour play session with their owner and a ball, or with another dog, can also satisfy their exercise needs. This is herding breed, so many Lappies enjoy participating in herding trials. Other canine sports in which they can excel include agility, obedience, rally, and tracking.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of about 7 weeks and 4 months helps to ensure that the Lappy grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. Like other herding breeds, the Finnish Lapphund is intelligent and quick to learn, but they also tend to be independent or even strong-willed. As a pack dog, the Lappy wants to be with his family, and undesirable behaviors can result if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time."
110,Finnish-Spitz,17.5-20 inches (male),25-33 pounds (male),13-15 years,5,5,4,3,2,2,Double,Medium,3,3,3,4,3,5,5,4,184 of 202,Gold-Red-Red Gold,White Markings,"The lively Finnish Spitz, the flame-colored, foxy-faced breed from the 'Land of 60,000 Lakes,' is a small but fearless hunting dog whose unique style of tracking and indicating quarry has earned him the nickname the 'Barking Bird Dog.'
The balanced, squarely symmetrical Finnish Spitz will stand not more than 20 inches at the shoulder and are easily recognized by their  foxy face and prick ears projecting a lively expression, and a curving plumed tail. Their dense coat of glorious golden-red which is never monochromatic gives them the Finnish Spitz 'Glow.' Finkies or Finns, as they are nicknamed, move with a bold and brisk gait.



 Finkies make excellent alertdogs, wary but not shy with strangers. This is a vocal breed '¿ in Finland, owners hold contests to crown a 'King Barker' '¿ and true Finn lovers are more delighted than annoyed by their breed's yodeling and range of vocalization. Finkies are eager canine athletes and eye-catching show dogs known to be smart, sensitive, and captivating companions.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Fortunately, thanks to thoughtful breeding, Finnish Spitz in the U.S. and Canada are a generally healthy breed and don't present many health issues. Responsible breeders screen potential breeding stock for patella, elbows, hips, and eyes, with the numbers of affected dogs very low. New owners are urged to have a conversation with their breeders about care for growing puppies, including the need to limit vigorous exercise, and avoiding early spay and neuter until maturity (3'¿5 years) is reached.","The Finnish Spitz is a ""natural"" breed that some owners refer to as ""wash and wear."" The breed standard is very specific: ""No trimming of the coat except for feet is allowed. Whiskers shall not be trimmed. Any alteration of the coat by coloring, dying, trimming, scissoring or other means must be severely faulted."" Lightly spraying the coat with water and brushing the coat using a pin brush every two to three days is adequate. Hot blow-drying will dry the outer coat. During their twice-yearly shedding season, daily brushing or a bath followed by a cool-temperature blow-dry and brushing will speed up this process, and a good quality comb and a slicker brush are very useful in getting out the undercoat. The shedding is more severe in an intact female. The coat of a spayed female can become softer and denser and can take more grooming.","Finnish Spitz were bred to hunt all day in dense woods, giving them the stamina to range far, making a solidly fenced yard a must. A Finnish Spitz must never be kept away from his people, as he becomes deeply bonded with his family. They require a moderately high degree of exercise. A daily walk, long or short, on a leash is always a reward in and of itself.","This is a very intelligent breed, and as such they can present a challenge to train. Keep sessions short and fun, being generous with praise and reward. Food seems to be the universal motivator. They'll let you know when they've had enough. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for the new puppy."
111,Flat-Coated-Retriever,23-24.5 inches (male),60-70 pounds,8-10 years,5,5,5,3,2,2,Smooth,Medium,5,5,3,5,5,5,3,4,91 of 202,Black-Liver-Yellow,,"The Peter Pan of the Sporting Group, the forever-young Flat-Coated Retriever is a gundog of relatively recent origin. Happy, self-assured, and willing to please, a good Flat-Coat will retrieve a duck or a show ribbon with equal aplomb.
The Flat-Coated Retriever's eponymous flat-lying coat comes in lustrous black or liver, with feathering at the legs and tail. A distinctive breed hallmark is the long head'¿unique among retrievers'¿which projects a smart and kindly expression. A Flat-Coat will stand as tall as a Labrador Retriever, but in silhouette they present a leaner, more elegant look.



 Dogdom's champion tail-waggers, Flat-Coats are among the happiest of all breeds. They mature slowly; some owners say that they never grow up at all, retaining a puppyish taste for rambunctious mischief into old age. This can be either delightful or exasperating, depending on your tolerance for such monkeyshines. This highly energetic breed requires lots of outdoorsy exercise.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","There are several health and genetic screening considerations specific to the breed. Responsible Flat-Coat breeders test their stock for conditions the breed can be prone to and communicate with other dedicated breeders regularly, working together for breed health and preservation of the breed's unique qualities. A Flat-Coat's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","The Flat-Coat's moderate-length coat requires a weekly grooming with a brush and a metal dog comb to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. The ears should be regularly inspected and cleaned if needed. The nails should be trimmed often, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort and problems walking and running.","The Flat-Coat is an active sporting breed and requires ample exercise every day for his physical and mental well-being. This can come in the form of long daily walks and play sessions with his owner. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in obedience, tracking, agility, rally, and other activities that can be enjoyed by dog and owner.","Flat-Coats are very intelligent, responsive, and eager to please, so they are generally easy to train. They have a sensitive nature and don't respond well to harsh corrections or training methods. A Flat-Coat wants to be with his family, and undesirable behaviors can result if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Flat-Coat grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."

The Frenchie is playful, alert, adaptable, and completely irresistible.
The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for the large, erect 'bat ears' that are the breed's trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular.



 The bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer. Dogs of few words, Frenchies don't bark much'¿but their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making new friends of the human variety. It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria swear by this vastly amusing and companionable breed.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Because of their front-heavy structure, Frenchies cannot swim and should never be left unattended near a tub, pool, or body of water. Like all flat-faced breeds, Frenchies are prone to breathing problems and do poorly in hot or humid weather. Flat-faced breeds are also more sensitive to anesthesia. Frenchies occasionally have eye conditions such as cherry eye, juvenile cataracts, or entropion, and skin allergies and autoimmune skin disorders also are known to occur. A responsible breeder will take advantage of available tests to screen breeding stock for conditions that can affect the breed.","The Frenchie's short coat sheds minimally. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will help to remove shed hair and keep him looking his best. Brushing promotes new hair growth and distributes skin oils throughout the coat to help keep it healthy. A Frenchie's facial folds should be kept clean and dry. The Frenchie's nailsshould be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause him pain.","A short walk or outdoor play session with their owner each day should provide enough exercise to keep the French Bulldog in shape. Frenchies enjoy participating in canine sports such as obedience, agility, and rally. As a flat-faced breed, however, they are prone to breathing difficulties and should never be allowed to exert themselves in hot or humid weather.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations will help him develop into a well-adjusted adult. Puppy training classes serve as part of the socialization process, promote good behavior, and help the owner learn to recognize and correct bad habits. Frenchies have big personalities and can need a fair amount of training to make them civilized companions. They can be stubborn, but at heart they're people pleasers and therefore easy to train. The proper motivation (such as food) and making a game of the process will ensure their cooperation."

He is an enthusiastic hunter, sociable with other dogs and an ideal companion in all circumstances. An excellent pointing dog, he also has a talent for retrieving.








 The French Spaniel is the Epagneul FranÃ§ais in his native country of France. A medium-sized dog, he is elegant, muscled and of medium proportions. His balanced construction provides the energy and toughness essential for his utilization. Highly intelligent in nature, his enthusiasm and willingness to work hard are his heritage. He is very easy to train.

One noteworthy difference is the GLP's affection for swimming and, therefore, waterfowl hunting. Coat color reflects the mixture of markings similar to a German Shorthaired Pointer.
German Longhaired Pointers are a gun dog and as such, they are expected to search, point, track and retrieve game. They can excel in all types of hunting situations: waterfowl hunting, searching for upland game birds, or retrieving furred game in the woods or prairies, typically rabbit and squirrel in North America. They have a unique ability in being able to switch from a calm household pet to a fiery, passionate hunter. Having been bred for hunting for over a century, they are a superior, tried and tested hunting companion.

They'll stand about knee-high to the average adult. Muscles ripple beneath a shimmering coat of red or black-and-blue with red accents. There's nobility in the elongated, wedge-shaped head, and the dark eyes are alert and eager. GPs move with the kind of strong, free-and-easy gait that tells you this is a confident companion, up for anything the day might bring.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","German Pinschers are typically robust, healthy dogs, although there are a few conditions that the breed can be prone to. These include hip dysplasia, eye disease, and von Willebrand's disease. There is a small incidence of heart problems, and some delayed post-vaccine complications have also been reported within the breed. Responsible breeders test all breeding stock for conditions that can affect the breed. The teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","The German Pinscher's short, dense coat needs little maintenance. Weekly grooming with a brush and an occasional bath will keep him shiny and looking his best. As with all breeds, his nails should be trimmed monthly if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can be painful and cause problems walking and running. His ears should be checked weekly and cleaned if needed of any dirt or excess wax.","The German Pinscher is an agile and athletic, high-energy breed who requires ample daily exercise for his physical and mental well-being. The breed is medium sized and robust, with a strong prey drive. Alert and intelligent, they are outstanding performance dogs as well as companions. They excel at anything that challenges their considerable physical and mental abilities, including canine sports such as obedience, agility, rally, tracking, and barn hunts.","German Pinschers are highly intelligent'¿so much so that they can be manipulative. They require a firm and knowledgeable owner, preferably with previous experience with other working dogs. This willful, mischievous breed requires lots of early socialization and obedience training. The main challenge is to keep the German Pinscher interested and engaged. He is a high-energy dog who is alert to his surroundings; he is inquisitive and will explore whatever is new and interesting. They are not ideal as a first breed for inexperienced dog owners."

Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight.
German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds.



 There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.'","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Most German Shepherds are healthy dogs. A responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as degenerative myelopathy and elbow and hip dysplasia. German Shepherd Dogs can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur.","The German Shepherd Dog has a medium-length, double coat consisting of a dense, harsh, and close-lying outer coat with a softer undercoat. The breed is easy to maintain, usually requiring just a quick brushing every few days or so to help remove loose hairs, but they do shed more profusely once or twice a year. During these periods, more frequent brushing will help control the amount of hair that ends up around the house and on the furniture. The German Shepherd only needs an occasional bath. It is important to trim or grind his nails every month if they are not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause pain and structural issues.","As a very active and athletic breed, the German Shepherd requires lots of exercise for his physical and mental well-being. A dog who is not exercised enough will become frustrated and likely to develop undesirable behaviors. With a puppy, you can start with short daily walks, as well as play sessions in a safely fenced area. Remember to not let the dog off leash, as even the best-trained dog can become distracted and not follow every command. Participating in canine activities such as agility, herding, tracking, and dock diving provides excellent physical and mental exercise and is fun and rewarding for both dog and owner.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital, and continuing obedience training will help ensure that the pup will grow to be an adaptable and well-mannered adult. The German Shepherd is a highly intelligent companion and an extraordinary worker. Consistency and positive, reward-based training will yield excellent results. He is extremely bonded to his people, so he is happiest when he lives with his family. He should be raised in the household and exposed to the family's activities.

GSP people call their aristocratic companions the 'perfect pointer.'
Male German Shorthaired Pointers stand between 23 and 25 inches at the shoulder and weigh anywhere from 55 to 70 pounds; females run smaller. The coat is solid liver (a reddish brown), or liver and white in distinctive patterns. The dark eyes shine with enthusiasm and friendliness. Built to work long days in the field or at the lake, GSPs are known for power, speed, agility, and endurance. 'Noble' and 'aristocratic' are words often used to describe the overall look.

 GSPs make happy, trainable pets who bond firmly to their family. They are always up for physical activities like running, swimming, organized dog sports'¿in fact, anything that will burn some of their boundless energy while spending outdoors time with a human buddy.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","Although German Shorthaired Pointers are generally healthy, there are some conditions the breed may be prone to. Among these are hip dysplasia, eye conditions such as progressive retinal atrophy, and certain heart diseases. A responsible breeder will screen their breeding stock for conditions that affect the breed. GSPs can also be affected by bloat, a life-threatening condition where the stomach suddenly distends and often twists as well. Owners should educate themselves as to what symptoms indicate this is occurring and what to do should it occur.","The GSPs coat is easy to groom most of the year, requiring only a good once-over with a brush or grooming glove every few days. Although the coat is short, it still sheds'¿especially at certain times of the year, when more frequent brushing will be needed to remove the loose hairs before they end up all over the house. The hairs can become embedded in fabrics and carpet and hard to get out. An occasional bath (using a gentle shampoo) can help. The ears should be regularly inspected and cleaned, and the nails trimmed short.","The GSP does best with plenty of exercise and things to do, such as running, swimming, and dog sports'¿in fact, anything that will burn some of their boundless energy while spending time outdoors with a human buddy. Their routine should ideally include ample physical activity twice a day. This might be in the form of brisk, half-hour walks morning and evening or running and playing in a securely fenced area. GSPs are smart and athletic and excel in a wide range of canine activities that exercise mind and body, from field eventsto agility, obedience, and dock diving.","Early training is essential for the German Shorthaired Pointer. Socializationand puppy training classes are vital, continuing with practice in basic obedience commands. This is an intelligent breed that learns quickly with consistent training sessions. GSPs need a purpose, and without one they can be destructive if left to their own devices. The breed can be extremely challenging from 6 months to 3 years old. GSPs have a very high energy level and a strong prey drive, and they need an owner with an active lifestyle to guide the dog's exuberance and intensity into positive outlets."

He is very teachable and easy to train. His distrust towards strangers and lack of hunting instinct make him the ideal watchdog for the home. His indifference to weather, robustness and longevity are his most outstanding attributes.
Spitz breeds like the German Spitz are captivating on account of their beautiful coats, made to stand off by a plentiful undercoat. Particularly impressive is his strong, mane-like collar around his neck, called a ruff, and the bushy tail carried boldly over his back. His foxy head, alert eyes, and small, pointed, closely-set ears give the German Spitz his unique cheeky appearance. His coat comes in a variety of colors including white, black, cream, gold, black and tan, sable, and chocolate brown. Though easily trainable, this lively and intelligent breed can also have an independent streak. If properly trained (so as not to be too noisy) and well socialized, the German Spitz will be happy mingling with other people and dogs.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Some cases of PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), RD (Retinal Dysplasia), and Patella Luxation have been seen in the German Spitz, but a majority of this breed are generally healthy. Puppies should be bought only from responsible breeders who eye test their breeding stock. Working with a reputable breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed.","The German Spitz has a profuse double coat, which sheds twice per year. During those times, the entire undercoat is shed in the span of about 2 to 3 weeks. Daily brushing will be required to remove his old coat and his hair will inevitably be all over your clothes, furniture and floor. The good news is his shedding is quite minimal during the rest of the year. A quick brush every couple days and a thorough grooming once per week will suffice to keep mats and knots from forming. His hair should never be clipped off entirely, as you will remove the insulating properties of his coat. He also does not need to be bathed very often. Mud can be brushed out of his coat if allowed to dry first.","A moderate amount of regular exercise will suffice for the German Spitz. Though longer activity is unnecessary, he will happily keep up on an extended walk. Providing a secure area for exercise is highly recommended as he is a very curious dog and can wiggle through the smallest of gaps in search for other adventures. Ponds are also a hazard to this breed and should be fenced off. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching him new tricks. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather.



 Equally important is not to let your German Spitz become too bored. He is a lively and intelligent breed and, if left with nothing to do all day, he may become destructive or excessively bark.","Highly intelligent, the German Spitz learns quickly and is eager to please with motivational methods. He does not respond well to being made to do things however. One behavioral characteristic you may want to curb with training is his natural reaction to bark at anything new or unusual. Bred to be an alert watchdog, he is naturally very vocal, but this should not be allowed to become a problem. Your neighbors will not thank you for it either. With good training, this breed can excel at mini agility heelwork to music and obedience."

Around the house, the GWP is an eager, affectionate, and amusing family companion.
Standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder, GWPs are a bit taller and heavier than their close relative, the German Shorthaired Pointer. GWPs are balanced, well muscled, resilient, agile, and generally built to beat the bushes all day long without tiring. The harsh wire coat protects against thorny underbrush and foul weather, and the shaggy beard and eyebrows complete an intelligent, worldly expression.



 'The need for running in the great outdoors is a must!' says one veteran owner. 'This breed will not be happy to be on the couch all day.' GWPs are bright and eager, but their independent, inquisitive nature might frustrate novice owners.

The Giant must be brushed weekly, and clipped or stripped regularly to maintain a healthy and attractive coat. The owner should be prepared to spend time maintaining the coat or plan to have the dog periodically groomed by the breeder or someone whom the breeder recommends. The Giant's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","More energetic and up-tempo than most big breeds, Giants need lots of exercise. Long daily walks, play sessions with another dog, or romps in the yard with their owners will do nicely. Giants are great workout companions for people who run, bicycle, hike, cross-country ski, swim, or skijor. All of these activities require a very active partnership with the owner. The Giant needs companionship either in the form of a human he can play with, or another large dog. Finding games he will enjoy, such as hide and seek or tennis-ball chase, will exercise both mind and body and help keep him fit and happy.","Extremely intelligent and strongly territorial, the Giant Schnauzer loves his owners and feels great responsibility to protect them.

","Glen of Imaal Terriers are generally healthy dogs, but there are several health and genetic screening considerations specific to the breed. These include hip dysplasia and eye disease such as cone rod dystrophy. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for conditions the breed can be prone to. Caution should be taken to avoid unnecessary stress on the front legs during their first nine months of life. As with all breeds, the Glen's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","The Glen of Imaal Terrier's weather-resistant double coat, consisting of a rough outer coat and a soft undercoat, requires moderate brushing weekly to prevent matting of the furnishings (the soft hair around the ears, neck, legs and belly) and should also be stripped two or three times a year. They shed very little as a result of this effort. It does not take a great amount of time, and the bonding you achieve with your pup is well worth the time involved. Since Glens are a dwarf breed, a small but sturdy grooming table is a very good investment. It will make the process much easier on both of you. The nails should be trimmed regularly, and the ears checked weekly for debris or excess wax buildup.","A little more laid-back than the typical terrier, Glens require moderate exercise to stay healthy and happy. As a dwarf breed with slightly curved front legs, Glens should not be rushed into strenuous exercise such as long walks on leash'¿it's good to start leash training, but keep the walks short and fun. A small handful of the pup's regular kibble can be used to reward him for staying close while on leash. Let him run around the house or a fenced yard, perhaps chasing a toy or ball. He will flop down for a rest when he has had enough. Owners should prevent puppies from jumping off couches, going down steep stairs, or engaging in anything that might put undue stress on their growing front legs and joints. Pups need time for the growth plates in their legs to close before they do any jumping or start climbing or descending stairs. Going down stairs is more stressful on the front legs than going up. Some breeders have pups avoid stairs and jumping as much as possible until they are at least 9 months of age, as the growth plates will close sometime between 9 and 12 months. This is a normal part of the developmental process but especially important in dwarf breeds whose legs are short in relation to their body weight.","Glens are versatile, trainable, and very smart. They love people but normally won't get chummy with other dogs. They are quieter and less spiky than other terriers'¿but, still, they're terriers: brave, sometimes stubborn, and keenly interested in the doings of small furry critters, their natural prey. Like most terriers, they have a great deal of character and learn quickly, which can make training a joy, although they may get bored with repetition. Positive reinforcement is the key. Keep training sessions short: Five minutes of training two or three times a day is much better than one 30-minute session.

122,Golden-Retriever,23-24 inches (male),65-75 pounds (male),10-12 years,5,5,5,4,2,2,Double,Medium,5,4,3,5,5,3,1,4,3 of 202,Dark Golden-Golden-Light Golden,,"The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America's most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.
The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a 'merry action.'



 The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations.



 Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.



  ","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Goldens are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for health conditions including elbow and hip dysplasia; eye conditions such as juvenile cataracts, pigmentary uveitis, and progressive retinal atrophy; and certain heart diseases, including subvalvular aortic stenosis. The Golden's ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often.","Goldens heavily shed their thick, water-repellant double coat once or twice a year, and they also shed more moderately on a continuous basis. Most of the time, a good brushing-out with a slicker brush once or twice a week will remove much of the dead hair before it has a chance to fall onto the furniture. During times of heavy shedding, these brushing sessions turn into daily affairs. Baths help to loosen the dead hairs, but the dog must be completely dry before brushing begins. Otherwise, Goldens only need occasional baths to keep them clean. As with all breeds, the Golden's nails should be trimmed regularly.","Like most Sporting breeds, Goldens need plenty of daily exercise. A Golden who doesn't get enough exercise is likely to engage in undesirable behavior. Goldens make great companions on long runs and bike rides, although consultation with a vet is recommended before starting strenuous or high-impact activities that might cause stress to the dog's bones and joints. Many Goldens happily get their exercise on hunting trips or at field trials, as well as by participating in canine sports such as agility, obedience, and tracking.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of seven weeks and four months will help the Golden develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Puppy training classes serve as part of the socialization process and help the owner learn to recognize and correct any bad habits that may be developing. Obedience training strengthens the bond between dog and owner'¿a Golden wants nothing more than to please his human. Golden Retrievers are outgoing, loyal, and eager to do your bidding, which makes them very easy to train."

Bathing monthly is recommended. Dry skin and dandruff can be prevented with bathing and conditioning.","Gordons were bred to be personal hunting dogs, and they also served as nannies. They live to cuddling by your side or at your feet, as well as running in a field. Their genetic makeup calls for them to have a drive to run, so they do need exercise. They can live in an apartment but if so, they need daily exercise, which can be met by walking, jogging, or biking with the dog. If they have a yard in which to run, they will self-exercise, though a Gordon will always be happiest doing something with their bonded owner. Being with their owner is what they live to do. Caution: To prevent bloat, never exercise the dog one-half hour before or one-half hour after feeding.","A few, simple lifesaving training commands are mandatory. A puppy or dog must be trained to know the command 'come,' and to come when called; to know his name and respond; and to obey the word 'no.' Gordons are stubborn yet very soft and loving, and they live to please their owner. They are very smart and learn quickly. The best training is for them to have a job to do, and the best job they can have is spending time with their owner'¿whether being trained or having fun. They are closely bonded to their family and live to be with them, but they are fine being alone when family is away.

","Like all breeds there may be some health issues. Some dogs may be faced with these health challenges in their lives, but the majority of Grand Basset Griffon VendÃ©ens are healthy dogs. Working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Grand Basset Griffon VendÃ©en can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize genetic testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","The Grand Basset Griffon VendÃ©en requires only a weekly brushing with a slicker brush and comb. Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep him clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your pet. Their strong fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Grand's quiet, docile demeanor makes them excellent companions and house dogs. Be prepared to give your new GBGV lots of exercise. They will not thrive as a couch potato. You must have a securely fenced-in area for exercise, since these hunting dogs cannot resist the urge to chase.

This breed is indeed great, but not a Dane.
As tall as 32 inches at the shoulder, Danes tower over most other dogs and when standing on their hind legs, they are taller than most people. These powerful giants are the picture of elegance and balance, with the smooth and easy stride of born noblemen. The coat comes in different colors and patterns, perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork pattern known as ""harlequin."" Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. But those foolish enough to mistake the breed's friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of true courage and spirit. Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Bloat, or gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), is the number-one killer of Danes. Owners should educate themselves to recognize the signs that bloat could be happening and what to do if so. Many breeders and owners consider a surgery called a prophylactic gastropexy ('preventative tack') that can help prevent some of the more serious aspects of GDV. Other health issues that can affect the breed include eye and cardiac diseases, hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis, and hip dysplasia. A responsible breeder will screenbreeding stock for conditions that can affect the breed.","For most of the year the Great Dane's short, smooth coat doesn't shed much, but given the size of the dog, this can still amount to a fair bit of hair. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will help keep shedding to a minimum. During shedding season once or twice a year, however, hair loss will be more profuse, with a daily brushing ideal. Great Danes need a bath only occasionally, unless they get into something messy. As with all breeds, the Great Dane's nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","Great Danes may seem sedate, but they require daily exercise appropriate to their age. A brisk walk two or three times a day can be enough. They can make good companions on jogs or hikes, but you must wait until the dog is 2 years old to avoid damage to growing joints. Because of the risk of bloat, avoid rigorous exercise around mealtimes. Danes tend to follow their nose wherever a scent takes them, so they should always be kept on a leash and only allowed loose in areas secured with a tall fence. Many Great Danes enjoy participating in agility, obedience, tracking events, weight pulls, and sports such as flyball.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. For a breed as large and powerful as the Great Dane, obedience training is a must. Socialization'¿gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations'¿will help him develop into a well-adjusted adult. Great Danes are sociable, friendly, and eager to please, and they respond well to firm, consistent training methods. They need to have human contact, affection, and socialization with other people and animals."

Pyrs today are mellow companions and vigilant guardians of home and family.
Frequently described as 'majestic,' Pyrs are big, immensely strong mountain dogs standing as high as 32 inches at the shoulder and often tipping the scales at more than 100 pounds. These steadfast guardians usually exhibit a Zen-like calm, but they can quickly spring into action and move with grace and speed to meet a threat. The lush weatherproof coat is all white, or white with markings of beautiful shades of gray, tan, reddish-brown, or badger.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Ethical Pyr breeders have excelled in their commitment to health issues. The Great Pyrenees Club of America has stressed having all dogs tested for a variety of conditions that can affect the breed, including elbow and hip dysplasia, eye disorders, luxating patellas, and neurological and immune-mediated disorders. Some cancers occur in the breed, as well as bloat, a life-threatening condition where the stomach suddenly distends and sometimes twists. All Pyr owners should educate themselves to know the signs of bloat, and what to do should it happen.","For all their abundant fur, Pyrs don't require a lot of grooming, as their coat is dirt- and tangle-resistant. They have a double coat, with a long outer coat and a soft undercoat. They will shed this undercoat with great enthusiasm'¿'leading to a snowstorm,' one owner says. She laughs, 'They shed in the spring, after whelping, in honor of certain Druid festivals, and after you enter them in a show!' A thorough brushing with a pin brush or slicker brush at least once a week will help to reduce the shed hair that ends up all over the house. The Pyr's nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort. The teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","Pyrs are not a highly active breed. The breed was developed to be a livestock guardian and has been used since ancient times to protect flocks from wolves, bears, and human foes. When working, they will patrol their territory but tend to conserve their energy for fending off whatever may threaten their flock. Moderate exercise such as walks with their owner will help keep them healthy and happy. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in canine activities such as obedience trials and cart-pulling.","Pyrs were bred to be independent thinkers, to work without guidance watching and protecting their flock. Although they are intelligent, standard obedience training will be met with great indifference. They don't see the point of all that sitting, heeling, and staying. They will let their boredom show by performing any task you deem important with extremely slow responses. Nonetheless, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended to help give the Pyr a good start in becoming a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."

Dependable and faithful Swissies earned their feed as herders, drafters, and all-around pasture dogs.
Greater than what? Well, standing as high as 28.5 inches and weighing as much as a midsize human, a Greater Swiss might easily be greater than you. Swissies are immensely strong, yet agile enough to move a flock across the sloping foot of a mountain. The coat is a striking tricolor, black, red, and white. The head and muzzle typically have a white marking (the ""blaze""), setting off a sweet expression. Several big mountain-dog breeds are described as majestic, but Swissies practically invented the word.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","The GSMD does not have any breed-specific disorders but can have health problems that affect large-breed dogs. This can include orthopedic issues, although overall the GSMD's orthopedics tend to be very good for a large breed. Splenic torsion, unrelated to gastric torsion, occurs more often in this breed than in other breeds. Owners should be aware of the possibility of bloat and know the symptoms, and what to do should it occur. Urinary incontinence is fairly common in puppies and spayed bitches. Epilepsy can occur in any pedigree; genetic markers for this have not yet been identified. Overall the GSMD tends to be a very healthy breed. More information on breed health can be found on the website of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of America.","This is basically a 'wash and wear' breed, but they are double coated and do blow their undercoat, usually twice a year. When this is occurring they benefit from a good bath and blow-out, followed by a thorough brushing with a rake or shedding tool. For the rest of the year the occasional bath and brushing usually does the trick. They need regular nail-trims and ear and teeth cleaning.",The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog requires moderate exercise. A walk around the block or a romp in the woods generally will satisfy their daily exercise needs. This breed is much better suited for the person looking for a hiking companion than the person wanting a bicycling or marathon-running partner.,"The GSMD is very food motivated and responds well to training using food rewards. They can also have a stubborn streak, however, so their owners must be more determined than they are. It is not recommended to use any harness-type training device on this breed. They are a draft breed, and the use of a harness (other than for draft work) just tends to make them pull that much harder. As with all dogs, early socialization and puppy training classesare recommended."

For thousands of years these graceful hounds have been an object of fascination for artists, poets, and kings.
Greyhounds are the essence of the dog breeder's credo 'Form follows function.' From the narrow, aerodynamic skull to the shock-absorbing pads of the feet, Greyhounds are perfectly constructed for high-speed pursuit. The lean beauty of the Greyhound 'inverted S' shape, created by the deep chest curving gently into a tightly tucked waist, has been an object of fascination for artists, poets, and kings for as long as human beings have called themselves civilized. Greyhounds are the template from which other coursing hounds have been struck.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Greyhounds are overall very healthy dogs, although there are a few conditions the breed can be prone to. As are most deep-chested breeds, the Greyhound is susceptible to bloat and gastric torsion, a sudden and life-threatening enlargement of the stomach that is sometimes accompanied by twisting. Owners should be aware of the symptoms of bloat and seek medical attention immediately if they occur. A condition called Greyhound neuropathy seems to be isolated in the breed. Other disorders that can occur include cardiac and eye conditions. Responsible breeders screen their stock for conditions that can affect the breed.","The Greyhound's short, smooth coat requires little grooming beyond regular baths and weekly rubdowns with a damp cloth or hound glove. His strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort. The ears should be checked at least weekly for any buildup of wax or debris that could result in an infection, and cleaned if needed. The teeth should be brushed regularly'¿daily if possible'¿with a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","The Greyhound is the cheetah of the dog world. While perfectly happy to lounge around the house all day, he is capable of amazing speed and energy when faced with potential prey'¿or the chance to chase a tennis ball or a coursing lure. Greyhounds require a regular schedule of exercise time and opportunities to (safely) run full-out. They must only be allowed off leash in a securely fenced area, as they may not be able to resist the urge to run off in pursuit of perceived prey.","Training a Greyhound can be frustrating for anyone who does not understand the genetic origins of the Greyhound temperament. As a sighthound, or coursing breed, the Greyhound was developed to pursue game by sight rather than by scent. They course game independently of humans, making decisions on their own, unlike other types of hunting breeds that require a bit of direction. A Greyhound should be socialized from an early age with small animals and children. Keep training lessons short and sweet, as the Greyhound will become bored very easily. With his mild, sensitive personality, he needs a gentle approach in training, never harsh. Greyhounds are more interested in doing things *with* you than *for* you. They are very affectionate with their families, though they tend to be reserved with strangers."

When not hunting, they can be found in the show ring, as their striking color makes them a stunning show dog. Hamiltons have been used as service dogs in America since the late 90's, where their versatility and close bond with their people shine.
Hamiltonstovare are most commonly multi-purpose dogs; they are hunters, show dogs, and pets, all in one regal and versatile little package. As a hound, they follow their nose wherever it goes (and will not return for a good long while), so leashes and fences are a necessity with this breed. Unlike most scent hounds though, the Hamiltonstovare has an extremely high prey drive for both scent and sight. They can make excellent lure coursing dogs. In the home, they are a lazy, low maintenance dog who rarely sheds. Very food motivated, they can be easy to train despite their hound stubbornness, but higher competitive obedience levels are not usually an option. The only major problem with this breed is accessibility; there is only one breeder of Hamiltonstovare in the United States. Unfortunately, Hamiltonstovare have a rescue problem in the US as well, and some can be found in rural shelters in Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee.

","As a breed, Hamiltonstovare are very healthy and rarely diagnosed with inheritable diseases. Hamiltonstovare can get hip dysplasia and epilepsy, but it rarely happens. Care should be taken to not over-exercise them before their growth plates have closed. They are also sensitive to heat and cannot be outside for long periods of time in temperatures over 80 degrees.",Hamiltons require very little grooming and are very easy to keep clean. They are seasonal shedders that only shed low to moderately in the spring and fall. Hamiltonstovare also do not drool and rarely have a doggy odor. A bath once a month and proper nail and dental care are all that are required to keep them looking their best.,"Hamiltonstovare are an active breed but they do have an off switch. They are ready to warm the sofa one day and go for a 10 mile hike the next. Daily, they need at least a 20 minute free-run outside and also something to stimulate their mind. They are a highly intelligent breed that thrives on being with their people and doing things that make their people happy. They are hounds and will follow their nose so a securely fenced yard is recommended.","Hamiltonstovare are a highly perceptive breed and adore their people. They make excellent service dogs, especially for medical alerts and psychological alerting. They are also wonderful family dogs and generally get along with everybody and everything. Hamiltons do have a high prey drive though, so they may not be the best dog for homes with rodents or even some cats as pets.

In general appearance, the highly efficient Hanoverian is of medium-large size, well proportioned and powerful. Well set strongly muscled fore and hind limbs qualify him for tireless work. His broad, deep chest provides ample room for the lungs and enables long, strenuous chases. The slightly wrinkled forehead and the clear, dark eyes produce the serious expression typical of the Hanoverian Scenthound.

Working with a responsible breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed.","The Hanoverian Scenthound's grooming requirements are quite low. He has a short coat which will rarely require brushing and he should be bathed as rarely as possible. The ears of the Hanoverian Scenthound, however, should be regularly checked for signs of infection or irritation. His nails need regular clipping and his teeth should be brushed when needed.","The Hanoverian Scenthound needs a good deal of daily physical activity. If deprived of proper physical and mental stimulation, it may likely lead to some unwelcome behavioral patterns including destructiveness, nervousness and constant barking. The Hanoverian Scenthound should be provided with enough space to roam and play. He has a great stamina and will make a willing hiking, camping or jogging companion.","Training a Hanoverian Scenthound can be challenging because of its independent nature.

If they get all the activity they need, they can be adaptable to a range of home situations. While they are happiest living indoors with their human family, they make great companions on long walks or hikes. Because they were bred to hunt and chase animals and to follow a scent, they should only be allowed loose in areas that are securely fenced, and any walks must be taken on a leash. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in canine sports such as tracking, rally, coursing ability tests, and other activities that can be enjoyed together by dog and owner.","Like many other hounds, Harriers are loving and amiable but also tend to have an independent nature, and they can be stubborn.

These vivacious and sociable companions are becoming especially popular with American city dwellers.
¿Distinctive features of the Havanese include a curled-over tail and a gorgeous silky coat, which comes in a variety of colors. Some owners enjoy cording the coat, in the manner of a Puli, and others clip it short to reduce grooming time. Happily, Havenese are just as cute no matter what hairdo you give them.



 Their small but sturdy bodies, adaptable nature, and social skills make Havanese an ideal city dog, but they are content to be anywhere that they can command the attention of admirers young and old alike. Havanese, smart and trainable extroverts with the comic instincts of a born clown, are natural trick dogs. Havanese are also excellent watchdogs and take the job seriously, but will usually keep the barking to a minimum.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.

The Havanese Club of Americapresents awards for members' dogs passing and registering Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) results for at least four specific health tests for the breed: an annual eye exam (CAER), a hearing test (BAER), a hip x-ray, and patella (knee) certification.","The long, soft, and silky coat of the Havanese needs to be groomed daily to be kept free of mats and tangles. This can be done by gently running a comb or soft brush over the dog while he is on your lap. Pet owners often choose to have their dog's coat clipped to a short trim to reduce grooming time. The Havanese should also be bathed occasionally as needed. The corners of the eyes should be gently cleaned daily to prevent tear-stain of the lighter-colored hair in the area. Check the ears often to remove excess wax or accumulated debris, and wipe out the inside of the ear-flap with a slightly moistened gauze or paper towel.","The Havanese has moderate exercise needs. They will benefit from a brisk daily walk or a fun playtime with their owner in the backyard, as they are happiest when someone is with them. Romping inside the home can also provide enough activity. Never over-exercise a Havanese of any age. If they are panting and struggling to keep up, it is time to go home. Havanese do well in both houses and apartments, but they are not happy left alone for hours at a time.","Havanese are highly intelligent and eager to please, and they are easily trained so long as you use only positive methods. This can be a sensitive breed, so care must be taken to not scold them harshly. Socialization from an early age is very important. Expose them calmly to a wide variety of new places and new people, always ensuring that the experiences are positive and not intimidating. Gentle, patient training will result in a wonderful companion dog. They are affectionate with people and get along with other nonaggressive pets."

The Hokkaido is a medium-sized, strongly-built dog. They have longer, thicker coats than the other Japanese breeds, and also have wider chests and smaller ears. Like all the Nihon Ken, they have a double coat made up of protective, coarse outer guard hairs, and a fine, thick undercoat that is shed seasonally. The breed comes in several colors: white, red, black, brindle, sesame, and wolf grey. With early training, the Hokkaido is a very loyal and dedicated companion who wants to please his human family. They are incredibly intelligent thinkers and problem solvers, and they excel at tasks given to them. If not socialized properly, however, Hokkaido can become wary of strangers and protective of their families. The breed is extremely rare outside its native country. In Japan, there is an estimated population of around 10,000-12,000, and yearly registrations of between 900-1000.

","Well-bred Hokkaido are generally very healthy, living 12-15 years average... However, like all breeds they are prone to hereditary diseases. Hokkaido are prone to collie eye anomaly, hip dysplasia, luxating patella, heart murmurs, idiopathic seizures, anxiety, psychogenic polydipsia, and pica. When living with a Hokkaido, it is important to monitor them frequently to make sure they are not chewing on items which can cause them harm. Inspect all toys carefully and frequently, and throw away toys that are broken or contain small pieces which can be ingested.","The Hokkaido is a fairly self-managed breed. The natural oils on their skin and coat help to keep them clean and dry despite unfavorable weather conditions. No trimming or shaving of their fur is required or recommended, just regular brushing to remove dead fur and keep the coat healthy. Hokkaido blow their undercoat roughly twice yearly. During this time, a bath and frequent brushing to remove the dead fur is necessary. Their nails should be trimmed regularly to avoid overgrowth and cracking. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Hokkaido are generally a very active breed. They are best suited for an active family who enjoys spending their time outdoors hiking, biking, jogging, and/or camping. Like all working breeds, it's best to give them a 'job' to do. Hokkaido excel at performance events such as agility, rally, flyball, weight pull, lure coursing, dock diving, and more. Without proper physical and mental stimulation, Hokkaido can become bored, anxious, and hyperactive in your home. If letting your Hokkaido run in your backyard, you should have a six foot fence, as they are good jumpers.

They take approximately two years to mature. Currently, Hovawarts in North America are participating in search and rescue organizations, therapy dog activities, obedience trials, agility trials, flyball and service dog training. Owning a Hovawart can be quite a challenge, and they require significant time and attention from their owners, so they are not recommended for first-time dog owners. However, for an owner who is willing to expend the effort to teach their dog appropriate behaviors in different situations, the reward is a faithful companion. The Hovawart is a family dog. It develops a strong bond to its 'pack' and must be a part of the family life; it needs to bond closely with the owner/family. If it has been well integrated into the family, it does not mind spending the occasional hour in a kennel.

  Hovawart Club of North America

  info@hovawartclub.org","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Hovawarts are quite healthy and live to a ripe old age. One can expect an average lifespan in the 10 to 14 year range and owners should be prepared to dedicate this amount of time to their care. There are no known issues of breed-specific diseases and hip dysplasia rates have been calculated at less than 5%. For a large breed dog, this is an exceptionally low rate.","Because the Hovawart does not have much of an undercoat, it does not need much grooming. Apart from the period of shedding, an occasional brushing will suffice. Beyond this, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Their strong fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Hovawarts are a large breed so the more running room they have, the happier they will be. It is preferable to have a large fenced yard, but substitute exercises such as hiking, trips to a dog park, etc. can make up for some lack in this area. It needs at least a one-hour walk, plus 3 or 4 shorter walks to do 'its business' daily. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise. Apartments are not typically large enough, or have room enough, for the desired activities.","The Hovawart's guarding instincts are best controlled by socialization and exposure to different situations and stimuli. This will allow the dog to understand how each situation should be approached and utilizes the dog's intelligence to assure a measured response. Absent directions, the Hovawart will make his own decision, and it may not match what you want him to do. Training is needed so the dog understands how you want it to make decisions and not rely on its instincts. Appropriate guarding instincts are a learned process, and the dogs need to be educated by exposing them to these situations.



 It is up to the Hovawart owner to be more alert, intentional, directive, and consistent than his dog. The Hovawart needs a leader it can trust. He does not respond positively at all to harsh methods of training; it is much more important to create and sustain the fundamental trust that it wants to feel toward its pack leader."

World-class sprinters and leapers, Ibizans need ample space to air out their engines.
Ibizans are lithe and leggy visitors from the dawn of civilization. Art history students will recognize the elongated head, with its large erect ears, as a familiar motif of ancient Egypt. The elegant, racy body stands 22.5 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder, with coat colors of solid red or white, or red and white patterns. The rosy-colored leathers of the nose, eye rims, and lips, along with amber or caramel eyes, perfectly complement the coat. The breed's quiet grace is often described as deer-like.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more.

","Ibizan Hounds are generally healthy dogs, though there are some conditions the breed can be prone to. These include hip dysplasia, eye disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, and congenital deafness. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for conditions that can affect the breed. The website of the breed's national parent club The Ibizan Hound Club of the United Statesprovides detailed information on breed health. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","Ibizan coats come in smooth and wire varieties, with a wide range in how profuse the wire coat can be. Both varieties should be groomed upright earsshould be checked weekly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which could result in an infection. The teeth should be brushed often, daily if possible, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","Beezers are very athletic and require a lot of exercise. It is not uncommon for an Ibizan to be able to jump five or six feet from a standing position, so a tall, secure fence is the order of the day for owners of this breed. The Beezer will enjoy vigorous daily play-sessions with his owner or with other dogs, or he can go for long walks a couple of times a day. The Ibizan has a very strong prey drive and should not be allowed off leash in an uncontrolled setting, as he is apt to take off on a chase after perceived prey at a moment's notice. The breed makes a wonderful companion for a regular jogger.","Versatile and trainable, Ibizans make excellent family pets. The breed is even-tempered, affectionate, and loyal. The Ibizan is bit aloof but a sweet-natured, family-oriented housemate. Alert and watchful of strangers, they are nevertheless friendly and outgoing dogs. Puppies should be cheerful, playful, and healthy. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Ibizans excel in a number of canine sports, including lure coursing, obedience, agility, rally, and tracking."

A densely coated Nordic spitz-type breed, Icelandics are enthusiastically devoted to their humans.
Icelandics are one of the 50 or so northern breeds from around the world classified as spitzes. The breed's ""spitziness"" is expressed by a dense coat, foxy face, pointed ears, and a bushy, curling tail. Icelandics, standing no higher than 18 inches at the shoulder, are just under what we'd consider medium sized. They come in several predominant colors, always accompanied by white markings. An endearing trait is the facial expression: friendly, happy, always looking as though there's no place they'd rather be than with you.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","The Icelandic Sheepdog has a profuse double coat, with a longer outer coat and a dense undercoat. Icelandic Sheepdogs shed a fair amount, even more so during shedding season, which occurs twice a year. Weekly brushing'¿daily during shedding season'¿will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Any tangles can be worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog.","Icelandic Sheepdogs enjoy outdoor activities and make great companions on long walks or hikes. Moderate exercise every day will help keep them healthy and happy. This can come in the form of walks and play sessions. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in canine sports such as obedience, herding, tracking, agility, rally, and other activities that can be enjoyed by dog and owner.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Iceland Sheepdog grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion.

Fun-loving, friendly, and high-spirited, Irish Red and Whites are a bit shorter and stockier than their cousin the Irish Setter.
Sportsmen thrill at the sight of a noble Red and White frozen on point, motionless as a statue. These medium-to-large bird dogs are powerful, solid, and sinewy, with enough stamina and bird sense to get the job done any day of the week and twice on Sunday. The stunning coat, vivid red islands floating on a sea of pearl white, has a practical function: It enables hunters to spot their dog at a distance. The handsome face projects a keen but kindly expression.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Irish Red and White Setters are generally healthy dogs, although there are some issues the breed can be prone to. Some that present themselves occasionally include posterior polar cataracts (cataracts that form in the back of the eye), hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, von Willebrand's disease (a blood clotting issue), hypothyroidism, and immune disorders. The breed's gene pool is not large, so genetic testing is especially important. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for conditions that can affect the breed.","Grooming the Irish Red and White Setter is a fairly simple job. It is important that the breed look as natural as possible, although scissors or clippers might be used to tidy up the rough edges just for the sake of neatness. An all-over grooming once a week with a soft brush and a slicker or comb to eliminate any tangles will keep the dog looking his best. The ears should be checked weekly for any excess wax and debris. A bath every month or so is usually sufficient. Nails should be trimmed every few weeks, as needed.","The IRWS is a high-energy dog and requires a lot of exercise. A bored and under-exercised IRWS can be a handful to live with. Provide the IRWS puppy with plenty of low-impact activity to channel his abundant energy and stimulate his mind. While this breed is in its growth stage (puppy to 18 months), it is important to give them regular exercise and long walks while also protecting their forming joints'¿this means no jogging or biking. Free exercise in a fenced area is ideal and means the pup stops when he is tired. Upon maturity, the Irish Red and White Setter is an ideal walking, hiking, and biking companion.","The breed's high spirits can make them a challenge to train. A key is to keep training sessions short, interesting, and upbeat. The IRWS is very eager to please and reacts well to a positive training approach involving lots of praise. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. His intelligence, energy, and devotion to his human make him a natural at obedience, hunting, tracking, and agility."

They are famously good family dogs: sweet-tempered companions for the folks, and rollicking playmates and tennis-ball fetchers for the children.
The Irish Setter has been described by its partisans as the most beautiful of dog breeds. Standing more than two feet at the shoulder, with a substantial yet elegant build, the Irish is famed for a brilliant coat of mahogany or chestnut. Long, sinewy legs and powerful rear drive help to place the Irish among the swiftest of all sporting dogs.



 The Irish Setter's lovable personality has endeared the breed to sportsmen and pet owners for more than 200 years. Irish are outgoing dogs who enjoy making friends. These rambunctious redheads are big kids at heart, but they are eager to please and will respond to patient, positive training.

","Irish Setters are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia and eye disorders. Like other large, deep-chested breeds, Irish Setters can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen; owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur. An Irish Setter's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","The Irish Setter's stunning rich-red coat requires moderate grooming to look its best. Irish should be brushed at least twice a week with a pin brush or a soft bristle brush; a long-toothed metal dog comb can also be used to help work out any tangles or mats that may be starting to form. The nails should be trimmed once a month. An occasional bath with a gentle shampoo meant for dogs will help to keep the coat and skin clean and healthy. Grooming sessions are a good time to check the dog all over for any new lumps or skin problems, and to check that the eyes and ears are healthy and trouble free.","Like most Sporting breeds, Irish Setters need plenty of daily exercise.

Known for his fiery red coat and a temperament to match, the Irish Terrier is stouthearted at work and tenderhearted at home.
Irish Terriers are the prototype of a long-legged terrier. Standing about 18 inches at the shoulder, they're sturdy but lithe and graceful. Every line of the body is eye-catching, and the overall picture is beautifully balanced. The tight red coat is as fiery as the breed's temperament. ITs are a dog lover's delight: If your heart doesn't go pitty-pat at the sight of this Technicolor terrier framed against the vivid greens of the Irish countryside, forget dogs and buy a goldfish.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Irish Terriers are generally healthy dogs, but there are some issues that the breed can be prone to. Hyperkeratosis (hardened, cracked footpads) is rare in North America but may be carried in dogs from European lines. A genetic test has recently been developed for this condition. Cystinuria (resulting in bladder stones) is also uncommon, but there is no genetic test for Irish Terriers. Prospective owners should ask about these two diseases and only work with reputable breeders. As with all breeds, the Irish Terrier's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","The Irish Terrier's short coat requires regular brushing, stripping, and trimming to keep it in good condition. His dense and wiry broken coat hugs the body and creates a tight, water-resistant jacket. Underneath the stiff outer coat, a dense undercoat of softer, finer hair traps body heat on a cool, damp day. Ideally the outer coat should be hand-stripped rather than clipped. Weekly brushing will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. The nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.","The Irish Terrier is lively, playful, and outgoing, possessing abundant energy. Irish Terriers are great athletes and need regular exercise, so a fenced backyard is ideal. Failing this, they require walking'¿always on a leash'¿several times a day to maintain mental and physical fitness. Although willful, the Irish Terrier wants to please his owner and excels as a show and performance dog. Obedience, agility, rally, earthdog, and flyball events provide an outlet for the breed's energy, natural athleticism, and intelligence.","The Irish Terrier is very smart and willing to please, though he also tends to be strong-willed, independent, and challenging. Early and consistent socialization and basic obedience training help to ensure he will be a well-mannered member of your household who is comfortable with family and friends. Training quickly establishes a bond between you and your Irish that will last a lifetime. Consistent use and reinforcement of early training should be a lifelong process. The Irish Terrier is a smart, quick dog who quickly adapts to new situations. This breed is great with children when raised with them and is deeply loyal to his owner. Pups require firm boundaries so they will grow into respectful adults."

Most IWS are healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia, allergies, and thyroid disease. Good breeders will utilize health screening and genetic testing to produce puppies who are as healthy as possible. Discuss any health questions with both your puppy's breeder and your veterinarian so you can make informed decisions about your dog's health.","Begin grooming the Irish Water Spaniel when he is still a puppy and may not need a lot done yet. He should learn early on that grooming time is a positive experience. Gentle brushing and nail and ear cleaning should always be part of the grooming regimen. Suitable for allergy sufferers, the breed's hypoallergenic coat requires brushing at least weekly and trimming every two months to neaten and shape it. If you do not want to learn to scissor your IWS to keep him from looking ragged, you can make regular appointments with a groomer who is familiar with the breed.","A typical sporting dog, the Irish Water Spaniel is an active, high-energy companion. He is eager to please, making him relatively easy to train, but he needs lots of daily exercise. Long walks or hikes, running alongside a bicycle, chasing a ball in the backyard, or playing with other dogs daily will help to keep him physically and mentally healthy, and relaxed and calm while inside the home.","The IWS is playful, smart, and eager to please.

Once fearless big-game hunters capable of dispatching a wolf in single combat, Wolfhounds today are the most serene and agreeable of companions.
The amiable Irish Wolfhound is an immense, muscular hound gracefully built along classic Greyhound lines, capable of great speed at the gallop. A male might stand nearly 3 feet at the shoulder and weigh up to 180 pounds. Females will run smaller but are still a whole lot of hound. The rough, hard coat comes in many colors, including white, gray, brindle, red, black, and fawn.     IWs are too serene to be fierce guard dogs, but just the sight of them is enough to deter intruders. IWs are characteristically patient with kids, though animals their size should be supervised around small children. Owning an Irish Wolfhound is a unique, rewarding experience'¿but acquiring a giant galloping hound is a commitment as big as the dog itself.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

Responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for health and genetic conditions such as pneumonia, heart disease, certain cancers and liver shunt. An annual examination, preferably by a veterinarian familiar with sighthounds, is recommended and should include an EKG. Extensive health information is available on the sites of the AKC breed club, the Irish Wolfhound Club of America, and its sister health organization, the Irish Wolfhound Foundation.","Irish Wolfhounds have a double coat that consists of a harsh, wiry outer coat covering a soft undercoat. They shed throughout the year, but not to an excessive degree. A thorough brushing once a week or so will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Unlike many double-coated breeds, Irish Wolfhounds don't 'blow out' their coats during an annual or semi-annual shedding season. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","Wolfhounds need exercise throughout their lives. Because they retain a strong instinct to hunt and chase prey, they should only be allowed loose in areas that are securely fenced, and any walks must be taken on a leash. As adults, Irish Wolfhounds can become couch potatoes if allowed to, but regular exercise such as long walks or play sessions will help keep them physically and mentally healthy. A home with a fairly large fenced area is necessary to provide the kind of environment in which they can thrive. The breed can also exercise mind and body by participating in canine sports like tracking, agility, and lure coursing.","Wolfhound puppies take 18 months or more to mature, and they can be very destructive, and possibly prone to injuring themselves, when left alone for extended periods. Puppies should have reasonable access to age-appropriate free play, but not with adult dogs, and with no forced exercise. Early socialization and puppy training classes (using positive training methods only) are recommended. Because of their intelligence, Irish Wolfhounds are fast learners. Wolfhounds crave the company of their people, and their sensitivity to humans makes them excellent candidates for therapy work."

IGs are Greyhounds in miniature'¿more slender, but a Greyhound's equal in grace and elegance. Standing ideally 13 to 15 inches at the shoulder, they present the sleek, curving lines common to all coursing hounds. Distinguishing features are the long, fine-boned legs.



 IGs combine the attentiveness of lapdogs with the complexity of ancient, aristocratic hounds. Bred for centuries to be doting companions and jesters, these high-stepping charmers refuse to be ignored. 'On the whole,' writes an IG expert, 'the breed would much rather be in your lap or bed than on the floor.' They are, though, true sighthounds and will bolt after quick-moving prey at the drop of a cat.

Although the IG is not as delicate as he looks, care must be take to avoid hazardous situations that might result in a broken leg. Extensive information about breed health can be found on the website of the Italian Greyhound Club of America.","The most important grooming tip for the Italian Greyhound is that the teeth must be brushed on a regular basis, preferably daily. Dental cleaning by a veterinarian should be done yearly or as needed. Baths are rarely necessary unless the dog has gotten into something that can't be removed from the very short, smooth coat by gentle brushing. The nails need regular attention, preferably with a grinding tool. They should not be shortened all the way to the quick. This breed has a hare foot, and the two middle nails can be left slightly longer than the other two.","IGs are an active breed and need regular exercise. For the most part, playtime will be sufficient for this, especially if there is more than one dog. Walks on lead are appreciated. Dog parks can be a hazard unless well supervised and having separate areas for small dogs. Even obedience-trained IGs should not be allowed off lead outdoors in unfenced areas, since small, moving animals are a huge incentive to run, possibly into danger.","This breed responds best to reward-based training methods rather than punishment. The trainer should be firm with commands and lavish with praise. Treats used as a reward should be small but immediate when the command is learned and followed. Professional dog trainers should be chosen carefully. Harsh methods just don't work with these intelligent, sensitive little dogs, even though they can be stubborn."

Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Options for exercise could include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, or retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather.

Descending from regional hunting dogs, the nearly extinct Akitainu was restored and preserved by dedicated breeders in the Akitainu Hozonkai. The Japanese Akitainu is known for its striking appearance, independent nature and spirit.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Autoimmune disorders, for which there are currently no genetic tests, such as sebaceous adenitis, uveodermatalogic syndrome, pemphigus, discoid lupus, food and environmental allergies, etc., affect this breed. There have been cases of amelogenesis imperfecta which can be screened for.  The national breed club requires testing of hips and eyes and strongly recommends screenings for patella, thyroid, and amelogenesis imperfecta/enamel hypoplasia issues.","A slicker brush may be used during grooming sessions during normal times. However, the Japanese Akitainu blows its undercoat twice a year. Profusely. So expect tufts of hair everywhere during that time. A bath, followed by cold forced air dryer and a comb out will help expedite the natural process of blowing coat. Nails should be kept trimmed using clippers or a nail grinder. Regular teeth brushing and maintaining ear cleanliness are essential not just for appearance but for health.  To maintain healthy and luxurious coats, gentle brushing every few days is recommended (depending on activities); for long coats, more frequent brushing will help to avoid matting.","The breed has a high prey drive and may be dog-aggressive; therefore, it is recommended to keep the Japanese Akitainu on leash in public spaces or around other animals and unfamiliar people. Regular walks and mental exercise are highly recommended for the breed. With proper training and precautions, they also make fine companions for outdoor activities such as hiking and camping.","The Japanese Akitainu responds best to positive training and methods that utilize their natural intelligence. They bore quickly with repetition, so short and varied sessions are more effective. Daily mental challenges and enrichment are necessary to keep dogs of this breed engaged. Because of their hunting background, Japanese Akitainu tend to enjoy using their natural instincts in nose work, barn hunt, and lure coursing."
145,Japanese-Chin,8-11 inches,7-11 pounds,10-12 years,5,3,5,3,2,1,Silky,Medium,3,3,3,4,3,3,2,3,104 of 202,Black & White-Black Tan & White-Lemon & White-Red & White-Sable & White-White & Black,Red Markings,"The Japanese Chin is a charming toy companion of silky, profuse coat and an unmistakably aristocratic bearing. Often described as a distinctly 'feline' breed, this bright and amusing lapdog is fastidious, graceful, and generally quiet.
Chin are the unrivaled noblemen of Japanese breeds. They're tiny 'indoorsy' companions, with an unmistakably Eastern look and bearing. The head is large, the muzzle short, and the round, dark eyes convey, as Chin fans like to say, a 'look of astonishment.' The profuse mane around the neck and shoulders, the plumed tail arching over the back, and the pants or 'culottes' on the hind legs project the elegant, exotic appearance so typical of Asia's royal line of laptop cuddle bugs.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Japanese Chin is a generally healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen for health concerns such as luxating patellas (slipping kneecaps), cataracts, epilepsy, and early-onset heart murmurs. Japanese Chin can be affected by a fatal neurological condition called GM2 gangliosidosis, or Tay-Sachs disease; using a DNA test, breeders can identify carriers and plan breedings to prevent the disease from manifesting in their puppies.","The long, silky coat of the Japanese Chin gives him the appearance of a high-maintenance breed, but he is surprisingly easy to maintain in top condition. He will require weekly brushing and a bath once a month or so, depending on his surroundings. The breed's nails grow very fast and should be trimmed regularly to keep them short and neat. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris that can cause ear infections, and teeth should be brushed regularly to avoid dental problems.","The Japanese Chin is a fairly active little dog. He will enjoy going for slow walks with his humans, or exploring his fenced backyard. The breed is an excellent choice for apartment living. Because of their stubborn nature, it is never a good idea to allow them to outdoors off lead. If they see something they want to explore, they are likely to refuse to listen to any commands or pleas. They are a bit reserved around new people, pets, and situations, but with proper socialization will enjoy going for romps in a supervised dog park with other small dogs.","Training a Chin can be simple for the trainer who can make them believe they are doing only the things they want to do. Bred strictly as companions for royalty, the Chin's only job throughout the breed's history has been to charm, amuse, and comfort their humans. They are often referred to as 'catlike,' and this trait can certainly be visible during training. They react well to positive training methods, but will shut down at the first hint of harshness. Training sessions must be interesting and fun to keep their attention. They love to learn tricks to perform for their adoring public."
146,Japanese-Spitz,12-15 inches,10-25 pounds,10-14 years,3,5,5,3,3,1,Double,Medium,5,3,3,5,5,3,3,3,,White,,"The Japanese Spitz are little comedians who want to make you happy and laugh. They are very loyal and smart and make wonderful companions. Game for adventures, they will tag along on a hike, a car ride, or a trip to the beach or lake. They love their humans and just enjoy being with them.
The Japanese Spitz, as a companion breed, enjoy the company of their families and truly are little comedians. They love to please their family and are thus eager to learn; they always have a smile on their face. Distinctive features include their pure white coat that has a mane-like feature about their neck. Also, like other spitz breeds, their tails curl over their back in a beautiful hair plume. A pointed muzzle likens them to a fox with a black nose, black eye rims, and ears of pointed triangles, which stand erect and move like radar towers, hearing everything going on around them and making this breed very alert.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Japanese Spitz, in general, are a healthy, active breed that can live a happy life of up to 12 to 14 years of age. Some cases of Patella Luxation have been found within the breed and this can be tested for by your veterinarian. Puppies should be bought only from responsible breeders as working with a reputable breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed.","The Japanese Spitz has a profuse, white, double coat. The undercoat, which they shed twice per year, is thick and generous, with an outer coat that is longer. When they ¿blow¿ their coat (aka shedding), the entire undercoat is shed in the span of about 2 to 3 weeks. Daily brushing will be required to remove the fur, but the hair will inevitably be on your clothes, furniture, and floor. For most of the year though, this breed is low maintenance and only requires a weekly brushing with infrequent baths unless the dog gets into something messy. Bathing too often can cause them to lose their natural oils and can irritate their skin, so once per season is sufficient. Luckily, the Japanese Spitz has a teflon-like coat ¿ that is to say, mud and dirt don¿t stick to their fur. If they do get muddy, you simply wait for it to dry and then brush it out. As with all breeds, the Spitz¿s nails should be trimmed regularly.","The Japanese Spitz adapts to many environments. They do well with lots of room to run like on farms and ranches, but also fare well in little spaces like apartments. Either way, they do need regular exercise and enjoy being with their families. A free, interactive run outside or a nice daily walk will benefit them physically and mentally. Afterwards, they will be glad to climb up on the sofa with you while you read or watch TV. An essential thing to remember about Japanese Spitz is that they are companion dogs; they just want you to spend time with them and they will make you laugh and smile in return.","The Japanese Spitz is an intelligent breed and their eagerness to please make them highly trainable. They crave companionship and interaction with owners so, if left alone for long periods of time, they may develop problem behaviors. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Without training they will learn things, but not necessarily what you had in mind."
147,Japanese-Terrier,10-13 inches,,13-15 years,3,3,3,3,2,1,,,3,3,5,5,1,3,1,3,,Black Tan & White-White,Tan Markings-Black Markings-Black Spots,"Japanese Terriers are a small, highly intelligent breed full of terrier temperaments. They are independent, active, crisp, and lively. As one-person dogs, they are often reserved with strangers. Keen and alert, Japanese Terriers will hear the slightest noise and give warning to any stranger. He has no issue with respectful children and other dogs. As a sporting terrier and versatile, eager-to-learn dog, he has great athleticism and inborn instincts. By the 1900s, at the end of the Meiji Era, some of these best dogs were seen in the Kobe streets, and were called the ""Kobe Terriers"". The appearance of these ""Kobe Terriers"" was like a mix of the modern Smooth Fox Terriers and the Japanese Terriers. These dogs were the first terrier-type dogs to be bred in Japan. The dogs had several names like ""Oyuki Terriers"" and ""Mikado Terriers"", and were kept by the Japanese as well as some foreigners.
Around 1916, in the Nada ward near Kobe, a dog named Kuro meaning black in Japanese was born from an out-cross breeding from English Toy Terriers and a Toy Bull Terrier both imported from the Western countries. With careful selections of the breeding pairs out of these offsprings and the Kobe Terriers a very short-haired, slim, small terrier type dog was born which are today known as the Japanese Terriers. By 1930, their work with the breed helped develop a standard and was finally recognized by the Japan Kennel Club. The Japanese Terriers did not become widespread until 1940, when they were seen in most major Japanese cities. The demand for this breed skyrocketed when these cities demanded for a small, more active dog than large watch-dogs. However, the breed faced two instances throughout its history where they faced extinction later on: first during World War II, and then around 1948 when the Western breeds became more fashionable.

Their teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure your dog has a long, healthy life.","The Japanese Terrier's short-haired, smooth coat requires minimal care. A weekly brushing with a soft brush or hound glove will keep his coat healthy and glossy, with an occasional bath only as needed. His ears should be regularly inspected for dirt or buildup of excess wax and cleaned if needed with soft gauze and an ear-cleaning solution. The nails should be trimmed often, keeping them short and neat, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort. Teeth should be brushed daily if possible, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","Japanese Terriers have moderate exercise needs. They require a couple of good walks or daily sessions in a fenced-in yard every day to maintain his mental and physical health. They enjoy activity but are also quite happy to curl up on the couch next to their owner. Due to their high trainability and versatility they can do well in a wide range of canine activities such as obedience, rally, and agility competitions.","The Japanese Terrier is extremely intelligent and trainable, although some can be stubborn and determined at times. Due to their high independence, training needs to be started early. Early socialization and puppy training classes with positive, reward-based training with gentle but firm corrections are highly recommended. A trainer who is terrier and primitive breed savvy are also recommended. Equally at home in the city or country, they are best kept in a fenced yard or on a lead, as they can eagerly run off. While they are one of the calmest of the terrier breeds, they are nevertheless high-energy dogs who require mental and physical exercises."

Medium-sized and natural in appearance, they are valued as independent hunters, discerning guardians, and loyal companions.
The Jindo Dog is a well-proportioned, medium-sized dog used for hunting and guarding. With erect ears and a rolled or sickle-shaped tail, it should be a vivid expression of agility, strength, alertness and dignity.The Jindo has a very strong instinct for hunting and is bold, brave, alert and careful, not tempted easily and impetuous. But most of all he is extremely faithful to his master. On the whole he is not fond of other animals, especially males. He also has a good sense of direction. A one-man dog, he readily accepts a new master, but never forgets his attachment towards the former master who raised him from puppyhood. He keeps himself clean and eats sparingly.

","Jindos are generally a healthy and long-lived breed with few known health issues. The lifespan for Jindos is often 14 years or more, and most live long, healthy lives. There are very few reported health issues within the breed, with hypothyroidism and discoid lupus being issues to be aware of. 

Systematic health testing has not been the norm until recently, so the true orthopedic and eye status of the breed has yet to be fully explored.","The Jindo is a fastidious breed whose double coat requires weekly brushing with a slicker or pin brush. They are known for being extremely meticulous and clean. Their double coat repels dirt and water, and they do not normally produce an odor. Throughout most of the year, their coat requires little more than weekly brushing to keep shedding at a minimum and the occasional bath for them to look their best. As with all double-coated breeds, twice a year the Jindo 'blows' its coat. During this time, the entire undercoat is shed over the course of a month or more, and both regular brushing of the dog and vacuuming of the home are required.","The Jindo is a high-energy hunting and guard dog with impeccable house manners. They were developed as a serious hunting dog capable of traveling many miles and taking down small and large game. This very athletic breed requires a reasonable amount of physical and mental stimulation. Be it guarding acreage or performing tricks for the neighbors' kids, Jindos love having a job to do and their needs are fairly easily met in an active household. They enjoy sports like lure coursing and agility, have run on sled dog teams, and are happy to turn their athleticism to any active task, even if that task is simply a nice long walk.   Inside the home, Jindos are polite and attentive. They will often follow their owner from room to room, not being clingy but happy to curl up in a corner where they can simply be near and watch over their person or family. If given an active outlet, they seldom bother anything in the home that is not theirs, and they are not a destructive breed.","The Jindo is a very serious hunting dog renowned for his loyalty to his owner and family. He is an extremely intelligent and independent dog with great problem-solving skills and the ability to think for himself. Jindos have a calm, confident, thoughtful nature, never fearful or aggressive without reason. Jindos are one-person dogs, very loyal to their owner and family and often reserved with strangers. The breed is keenly protective of their owner and property and is prized as an intelligent watch dog who does not react unless necessary. It is a breed characteristic for the Jindo to be extremely uncomfortable being forcibly restrained by a stranger. High prey drive is the norm for this extremely athletic hunting breed. The Jindo does not have much tolerance for rude behavior of other dogs and generally is not interested in interacting with strange dogs outside his home. Within the home, same-sex dog aggression is often the norm and opposite-sex pairs are highly recommended. Early socialization and puppy training classes are extremely important in order to expose the Jindo to the many things in his environment and give him the basic skills to become a good canine citizen. Jindos are extremely clean and are naturally housebroken at a very young age."

Traditionally used to hunt a wide range of game in the mountains of Japan, the Kai Ken is considered a rare breed even in Japan. The Kai is highly intelligent and learns quickly. They seem to learn as fast as the other Japanese breeds if not faster. They are not as independent and are more willing to please their companions. The Japanese describe the Kai Ken as a trustworthy guardian and extremely devoted to his master.
Kai Ken are athletic and intelligent with a strong desire to hunt. The Kai is an independent thinker and can form a strong bond with their family. They are excellent swimmers and climbers and have been known to climb trees and swim rivers in pursuit of game. Kai have a distinct brindle coat that comes in three colors: Black Brindle (Kuro-Tora), Brindle (Chu-Tora), and Red Brindle (Aka-Tora). Red brindle is the rarest of the coat colors. The distinct coloring and brindle pattern enabled the dog to blend in to the mountainous forests in which it hunted, camouflaging it against prey and predators in ancient times. The amount of brindle will vary from dog to dog as well as the brindle pattern. Most puppies are born completely black and their brindle will emerge as they age and will continue to change for around the first five years of their life. In the home, the Kai Ken requires basic canine care. They can be kept in an apartment setting provided they receive regular exercise in the form of leashed walks. Being a naturally clean breed, bathing should be limited to only when dirty. Brushing is recommended, especially during twice-a-year coat blowing.

Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities such as hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Kai Ken can be good apartment dogs if their exercise needs are met.

Their senses, especially smell, are sharp, thus the breed is suitable for big game hunting. They have a very good sense of direction, are balanced, courageous and persistent. This breed has a highly developed spirit for game and are very self-confident. They may be territorial towards other males, but are never aggressive towards people, though they may be slightly reserved.
The Karelian Bear Dog is a medium-sized spitz with a dense coat, but his standards are closer to that of non-spitz dogs such as the Samoyed and Siberian Husky, though the similarities end there. Bred to hunt large, aggressive game by himself, his build reflects his duties. He is a silent hunter, and only barks once the game is stopped or treed. Working with an experienced hunter, he communicates the type of animal he has located by the sound of his bark. Though he can demonstrate self-control around people, his fighting spirit surfaces around other dogs and can be difficult to handle. His spirit easily turns into aggression, as Karelian Bear Dogs love a challenge.

These tests include X-rays to screen for hip and elbow dysplasia, an exam for patellar luxation, a CERF eye exam, and genetic screening for primary hyperparathyroidism. Because the breed has been screened for these diseases by reputable breeders, the conditions have been reduced in the breed, and most Kees are free of them. When purchasing a puppy, it is the buyer's responsibility to ask for the test results of the pup's parents and discuss them with the breeder.","Keeshonden do require regular grooming, but going through their coats once a week with a pin brush usually does the job. This will keep the undercoat brushed out, and keeps shedding to a minimum. The only trimming needed is tidying around the feet, pads, and hocks.

154,Komondor,27.5 minimum inches (male),100 pounds or more (male),10-12 years,5,3,2,1,4,2,Corded,Long,3,3,5,3,4,3,3,3,173 of 202,White,,"A powerfully large Hungarian flock guardian covered in profuse white cords from head to tail, the Komondor is among the world's most recognizable breeds. The independent and protective Kom requires a firm, experienced hand at training.
Our Hungarian-language tip of the day: The plural of Komondor is Komondorok. Now, let's take a look at the dog. What we see is a large and powerful guardian covered in profuse white cords. A big male can stand more than 27.5 inches and weigh over 100 pounds, with heavy bone, a deep chest, and lots of muscle. Despite their brawn Komondorok are agile and light-footed, and move with long strides. With their unique look, it's impossible to mistake Koms for anything else.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","There are no known health problems specific to Komondors. Responsible breeders have breeding stock certified by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) as being free of hip dysplasia. The breed's parent club, the Komondor Club of America, also asks breeders for eye health certifications. As with many large dogs, the Komondor can develop bloat, a sudden, life-threatening enlargement of the stomach sometimes accompanied by twisting. Owners need to be aware of the signs of bloat and take quick action if those signs appear.","A beautiful corded coat is the result of special care. An experienced breeder reports, 'We never brush, but do wash the dogs regularly. When the coat starts to clump or '¿plate up' at 9 or 10 months, we start to split the clumps or plates into areas that grow out of an area on the skin about the size of a quarter. Those grow out into the cords. There is no reason for a corded coat to smell bad or be dirty. Bathing with dilute shampoo gets the job done. To finish the bath, make sure to rinse out every hint of the shampoo, and then dry by squeezing, using towels, and then in front of a strong fan overnight. If the coat doesn't get dry or has residual shampoo, it might smell badly.'","Komondors are agile and athletic for their size, and sufficient exercise is important to keep them healthy and happy. Free-running time in a large, securely fenced yard, going for walks, and playing with their housemate dogs all help a Komondor stay in shape. Dog parks are often a bad idea for Komondors. Developed as a livestock guardian breed, their guarding instincts can cause them to react badly to loose stranger dogs, or to the perception that a group of dogs might be a threatening pack.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are important for the Komondor, as are obedience training and a clear understanding that the ""person"" is in charge. They are independent thinkers and can be overly protective if not trained. Because of the dog should have learned to consistently follow commands by the time it is one year of age. Working toward an AKC CD obedience title is a perfect way for the Komondor to achieve this."
155,Kromfohrlander,15-18 inches,20-35 pounds,13-15 years,5,4,3,2,1,1,Wiry,Short,4,4,3,4,4,4,3,3,,White & Brown-White & Tan,,"The Kromfohrlander is a medium-sized companion breed that is sensitive, loving and loyal to its owners. He has a distinctive 'smile' and will sneeze to greet you. Pronunciation of the breed is ""krome-for-lahn-dair.""
The Kromfohrlander is a very intelligent, funny, agile dog which loves to climb and jump and easily excels at agility and dog-trick training but can be fussy with food. They come in two coat types: wirehaired (with beard) and smooth haired (smooth face with no beard and beautiful, long, soft hair). The breed's nickname in North America is ""Kromi"" (krome-ee). The Kromfohrlander was bred to be a companion only, retains very little hunting instinct (despite its terrier heritage), and is often long-lived (17-18 years old). He is good with children and family and tends to be a one-person dog. He is very attached to his owner, will not run away, and is first to alert to strangers.

","The Kromfohrlander is an extremely rare breed with a very small gene pool. DNA tests are available for hyperkeratosis and Von Willebrand's disease, which means breeders can identify carriers and avoid producing affected dogs; autoimmune problems have been noted in the breed. Keeping an eye on your Kromi's health throughout its life and sharing information will help everyone in the breed better understand the potential health of the breed.","To maintain a tidy appearance, regular hand-stripping or grooming is required. Most Kromis grow a scruffy, wirehaired coat that sheds. It is not to be clipped or shaved. They have little to no doggy odor and dirt just falls off their coats; they are remarkably clean dogs. It is important to continue regular nail clipping as this can become very difficult due to the typical sensitivity of the breed.","Though Kromfohrlanders only wish to be at the side of their special person at all times, regular outside exercise is a requirement. They enjoy fetching a ball or other dog toy. At around age three, they can jump to get a disc, as their joints must be mature. Long walks in a natural setting is the Kromi's favorite kind of exercise. This is NOT a dog-park breed, as they prefer only dogs they already know and do not care for new dogs, new people or new situations.",The Kromfohrlander is very intuitive and a very good guesser. Teaching the Kromi to learn is easy when young but advancing to activities that require more independence such as competitive agility can be a challenge due to the typical sensitivity of the breed. Patience is required.

A working dog of impressive size and strength, the imposing and thickly coated Kuvasz is a beautiful, smart, profoundly loyal, but challenging breed.
Imposing, impressive, majestic, massive, mighty, pick the adjective you like best, they all apply to the Kuvasz (pronounced KOO-vahz; the plural is Kuvaszok, pronounced KOO-vah-sock). This snow-white livestock guardian of luxuriant coat can stand as high as 30 inches at the shoulder, and weigh between 70 and 110 pounds. Despite their size and strength, Kuvs are quick-moving, nimble-footed protectors when meeting a threat. The breed's fans say that the elegantly proportioned head 'is considered to be the most beautiful part of the Kuvasz.'","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Kuvasz is a healthy breed overall, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, autoimmune thyroiditis, patellar luxation, cardiac conditions, and progressive retinal atrophy. No ethical breeder will object to questions regarding health testing results of their breeding stock. Large and deep-chested breeds can develop bloat, a sudden, life-threatening distention of the stomach that can be accompanied by twisting. Owners should learn what signs to look out for and what to do should they occur.","The Kuvasz has a double coat, consisting of guard hair and fine undercoat. His coat is very easy to care for, needing only weekly brushing to remove debris and reduce shedding. Beyond that, an occasional bath will keep him clean and looking his best. His nails should be trimmed every month or so if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause him discomfort.","Having been developed as a strong, active working dog, the Kuvasz requires daily activity for his health and happiness. A fenced yard is essential for this large and agile dog. Adequate and controlled exercise is a necessity for the rapidly growing Kuvasz puppy.","The Kuvasz possesses keen intelligence and determination and is extremely devoted to his family. While these qualities make them wonderful companions, they can also challenge the novice dog owner. Early socialization and puppy training classes are a must for the Kuvasz puppy. Training a Kuvasz takes patience, as this independent breed matures slowly. Sensistive problem-solvers, Kuvasz do not respond well to harsh or repetitive training techniques. The Kuvasz was bred to guard livestock, and he is a natural guardian and will protect family, house, and property."
157,Labrador-Retriever,22.5-24.5 inches (male),65-80 pounds (male),10-12 years,5,5,5,4,2,2,Double,Short,5,5,3,5,5,5,3,4,1 of 202,Black-Chocolate-Yellow,White Markings,"The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly, outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family looking for a medium-to-large dog.
The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering 'otter tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness.



 Labs are famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Labs are healthy dogs overall, and a responsible breeder screens breeding stock for conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, heart disorders, hereditary myopathy (muscle weakness), and eye conditions, including progressive retinal atrophy. A condition called exercise induced collapse (EIC) can occur in some young adult Labs; a DNA test allows breeders to identify carriers and plan breedings to avoid producing the disease. Like other large, deep-chested dogs, Labs can develop a life-threatening stomach condition called bloat. Owners should educate themselves about the symptoms that indicate this is occurring, and what to do if so.","The Lab has a thick, water-repellant double coat that sheds. Give occasional baths to keep them clean. As with all breeds, the Lab's nails should be trimmed regularly and his teeth brushed frequently.","The Labrador Retriever is an exuberant, very energetic breed that needs lots of exercise every day. A Lab who doesn't get enough exercise is likely to engage in hyperactive and/or destructive behavior to release pent-up energy. The breed's favorite activities are retrieving and swimming. Labs also love to burn up energy on hunting trips or at field trials, as well as by participating in canine sports such as agility, obedience, tracking, and dock diving. Many Labs also work hard in important roles such as search-and-rescue, drug and bomb detection, and as service and assistance dogs.","With the Lab's physical strength and high energy level, early socialization and puppy training classes are vital. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of 7 weeks and 4 months and beginning obedience training early on will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Puppy training classes serve as part of the socialization process and help the owner learn to recognize and correct any bad habits that may be developing. Labs are devoted, intelligent, and enthusiastic companions who need to be included in family activities."

Despite their plush-toy looks, Lagotti are durable workers of excellent nose who root out truffles, a dainty and pricey delicacy.
Italians have a word for it: 'carino.' In English, we say 'cute.' In any language, this breed is totally endearing. The Lagotto Romagnolo (plural: Lagotti Romagnoli) is known for wooly curls that cover the body head to tail, crowned by a lavish beard, eyebrows, and whiskers. Lagotti stand under 20 inches and weigh no more than 35 pounds. But don't be fooled by their teddy-bear looks, these are rugged workers of true strength and endurance. The breed's trademark curls feel and behave more like human hair than fur.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The breed is generally very healthy, and a responsible breeder screens breeding stock for health conditions such as juvenile epilepsy, storage disease, hip dysplasia, and elbow dysplasia. DNA testing aids breeding decisions aimed at avoiding the occurrence of disease.","The Lagotto's rough-looking, waterproof coat forms thick, tight curls that cover the entire body except for the head. They have a double coat of hair rather than fur and shed only minimally, although they may leave little tufts of hair once in a while. The coat needs to be trimmed on a regular basis. Some Lagotto coats mat more than others, and it is important to groom regularly to prevent this. The ears should be checked weekly for buildup of wax or debris, or any signs of infection.","As with most sporting breeds, the Lagotto requires an active, engaged lifestyle to keep him happy. They are not hyper and do not require a great amount of exercise, but they do need both mental stimulation and physical activity. While a Lagotto will enjoy and benefit from time outside, the breed will not do well if left to live outdoors without family interaction. The Lagotto needs to spend time with his family in order to be well adjusted and content.","Lagottos are alert, intelligent, and lively. They love to learn and please their owners and excel in canine events such as agility and obedience, as well as other pursuits like dock diving (they naturally love water). With their excellent nose, they are perfect candidates for scent work, search-and-rescue, and detection of medical conditions. Early socialization and training are vital and help to ensure that the Lagotto grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."

The Lakie's coat is hard, wiry, and low-shedding.
Square and sturdy Lakelands, standing less than 15 inches at the shoulder and weighing about 17 pounds, are small dogs. But don't tell them that. With their cock-of-the-walk swagger, Lakelands personify the old dog-lover's cliché ""a big dog in a small package."" They come in several colors; some have a sporty saddle mark on the back. With folded V-shaped ears, a straight front, rectangular head, and a mischievous twinkle in their eye, Lakelands are the blueprint of a long-legged British terrier.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","There are very few breed health conditions specific to the Lakeland Terrier, and none that have been reported at more than a very low incidence. As with all breeds, a Lakeland's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","Lakelands have a beautiful, harsh double coat when maintained properly by hand plucking. Finding someone who can pluck (or ""strip"") a coat is difficult, however. Clippering the coat will also suffice, but with this the color and texture of the coat will fade. Once clipped the coat becomes soft, with loose curls. The hairs tend to not drop out, instead staying caught up in the coat, so the Lakeland is considered a non-shedding breed suitable for people who can't tolerate lots of dander. Brushing weekly will help to remove the loose hairs and prevent mats.","When raised properly, Lakelands are not a hyperactive breed. A good, long walk or brisk jog daily along with frequent opportunities to run in a securely fenced area should keep them fit both physically and mentally. One longtime breeder notes: ""Physically, Lakelands can get enough exercise if they live in a two-story house. Mentally, they need to get a lot of exercise to grow up sane. Walks on short leads don't cut it. All-out running on a 20- or 30-foot line regularly seems necessary.""","The Lakeland needs early socialization, following up with a good basic puppy training class'¿with the class and trainer chosen carefully. A longtime breeder notes: ""Avoid training classes taught by people who do not understand the terrier mind. Lakelands are wicked smart; they learn quickly, and get bored quickly. Make the right thing easy and the wrong thing difficult, and reward good choices."" They learn fast but don't thrive on repetitive training'¿they are simply too smart to perform the same task over and over again."

Their small size is what gives them their charm.
Small, powerful, sturdily built, alert and an energetic worker, the Lancashire Heeler works cattle but has terrier instincts when rabbiting and ratting. They have a unique characteristic called the Heeler Smile; when content, Heelers have been known to draw back their lips in an effort that emulates a human smile. In 2003, the breed was placed on the Endangered Breeds list of The Kennel Club, U.K, due to the small number of dogs composing the gene pool and the risk of several inherited diseases.

","The Lancashire Heeler is a generally healthy breed living well into their teens. In 2006, primary lens luxation, an inherited eye disease, was found. Aggressive action by breeders and research by animal health organizations has reduced the incidence of PLL. It is important to ensure that parents and their puppies are eye tested.","The Lancashire Heeler is a breed that can go from the field to the show ring. Their short, hard, flat coat is dense and waterproof, needing very little grooming. A light brushing and occasional bath will keep your Heeler happy and clean. The nails should be trimmed, if needed, with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Lancashire Heeler likes exercise, human interaction, and mental stimulation. They can be demanding of your attention or somewhat laid back, but are always eager to play or just be by your side. Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience, and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.","Intelligent and quick to learn, Lancashire Heelers can have a mind of their own, so training should be kind but firm.

The Lapponian Herder is an independent, fun breed. They are very intelligent and generally eager to please. As a high-energy herding breed, they excel in many other dog sports besides herding, such as companion events. Its love of hard work makes it a wonderful breed in any event that is competitive and fun.

They have a gentle nature and serene patience and they relish the companionship of the whole family.
A huge and powerful dog, yes, but the Leonberger is also known for his aristocratic grace and elegance. A male can stand over 31 inches at the shoulder and weigh as much as a full-grown human. Females run smaller but are still a whole lot of dog. Breed hallmarks include a medium-long waterproof coat, lush triangular ears, a bushy tail, and a black facemask that frames kindly dark-brown eyes. A dramatic feature of the male's coat is the lion-like mane around the neck and chest. A well-built Leo moves with an easy, elastic gait. A Leo is friendly but nobody's fool. As watchdogs and all-around workers, they exhibit intelligence and sound judgment. Leos require lots of brushing, ample room for romping, and unlimited love.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","As with all canines, proper exercise and nutrition, routine vet exams, and parasite prevention are keys to a happy and healthy life. Large dogs such as Leos can experience bloat, where the stomach twists and gas is trapped inside. Bloat can quickly be fatal, and it is important to know its signs, such as drooling, restlessness, enlarged abdomen, and attempts to vomit. Owners of at-risk dogs can consider the preventative measure of having their dog's stomach surgically tacked to the abdominal wall.","Leonbergers shed a lot'¿and twice a year, they shed even more. A Leo should be brushed every day, especially in the areas of his body that tend to mat: the long hair behind the ears and on the backs of the legs. A more thorough grooming should be done once a week'¿and given the breed's size, this will take a fair amount of time. Leos have a thick, full outer coat and a shorter, fluffier undercoat. A metal comb and an undercoat rake can be used to work out the undercoat, and a pin brush and a slicker brush will neaten up the outer coat. In addition, a Leo's nailsshould be trimmed every other week.","If you live in a city apartment or a house on a small, suburban lot, this may not be the breed for you. Adult Leonbergers are generally calm and subdued, but they still need to have some vigorous exercise once a day. Puppies and adolescents are active and exuberant. Adult dogs can benefit from jogging or hiking with their owner or keeping pace alongside a bicycle. A large yard with a tall, strong fence is the ideal place for a Leo to run around. Remember, these are working dogs. Drafting'¿that is, pulling a cart'¿and agility training are two good ways for a Leo to get the activity he or she needs.","Leonbergers are very large and strong. In addition, puppies and adolescents have loads of energy and are extremely enthusiastic. With these facts in mind, proper training of the breed is essential. Leo puppies should be socialized by being gently exposed to a wide range of people, animals, and settings before the age of 20 weeks. Group obedience classes will help a Leo learn to be a well-mannered companion and canine citizen. A Leo is probably stronger than and may even outweigh his owner, and it is imperative that he learns to do what you want him to do."

They're famous for a floor-length, flat-hanging coat, parted in the middle and draping each side of the body. A feathery tail curls over the back in the distinct manner of Tibetan breeds. The breed's fans say the dark, oval-shaped eyes'¿peeping through lavish facial hair'¿are the windows of a Lhasa's merry soul.

","The Lhasa Apso is generally a robust, healthy dog. The most serious health problem in the breed is hereditary kidney dysfunction, which can be present in mild to severe form. There is no reliable test to detect carriers. Prospective owners should seek out experienced, conscientious breeders who are aware of the condition and remove affected individuals from their breeding programs. Breeders have made great progress toward eliminating this problem, and the risk of acquiring an afflicted puppy from a knowledgeable breeder is slim. Other conditions to inquire about are dry eye, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), slipping stifles, hip dysplasia, and cherry eye.","Long hair or puppy cut? Both require regular maintenance, and this is a choice for the owner to make. Lhasas in a puppy cut or other clip still should be brushed regularly and bathed between visits to the groomer. Long hair requires regular brushing, using the right tools and techniques. Expect to bathe a long coat at least every two weeks, and brush at least once between baths. Thorough rinsing is essential, as shampoo residue irritates the skin. Conditioners and finishing sprays make grooming easier. Freshly bathed long or clipped hair should be thoroughly dried and brushed, as damp hair, even when clean, will mat.","The Lhasa is generally not a couch potato and is adept at self-exercise. They will race around an apartment to run off energy, entertain themselves in a fenced yard, or take their owners on a brisk walk. Mental stimulation is as important as physical exercise. They excel at agility, can do scent work, and have been known to retrieve and herd. There are talented Lhasas certified as therapy dogs working in hospitals, nursing homes, colleges, and prisons.","Lhasa Apsos will please you if it pleases them to please you. They are highly intelligent, sometimes compared to a willful toddler. They can learn just about anything that a trainer makes interesting enough to master'¿on their terms. They do not appreciate repetitive drill and can become uncommonly stubborn if bullied or badgered.

The portable, non-shedding Löwchen is said to be affectionate, lively, and brave as a lion.
Small dogs with enormous heart, LÃ¶wchen (the same singular or plural) stand a bit over a foot tall at the shoulder. The coat is traditionally kept in a 'lion clip,' in which most of the hindquarters and tail are clipped down close to the skin. The overall effect is that of a mini lion, with a full mane and plumed tail. The coat comes in several colors and color combinations. Beneath the coat is a dog that's strong and sturdy, but elegant and artfully balanced.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The majority of Lowchen are healthy little dogs. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, patellar luxation (slipped stifle), cataracts, and progressive retinal atrophy. Your dog's breeder should provide copies of the parent's health-testing certifications so you can make informed decisions regarding your dog's health.","The LÃ¶wchen's grooming requirements are surprisingly few'¿a good brushing every few days, followed by a nice bath every couple of weeks will keep him looking and feeling his best. Nails should be trimmed and ears cleaned regularly as well. The LÃ¶wchen can visit a professional groomer (or his breeder) every couple of months to keep the hair trimmed either into a 'puppy cut' or the traditional 'lion' trim.","The LÃ¶wchen is a charming, lively companion. He loves to play in his fenced yard or accompany his owner on long walks. He is very intelligent and loves having new challenges, and he's a great candidate for obedience or agility. He won't be suited to go on long-distance runs, but he is a sturdy little dog who can be happy doing just about any activity with his people.","With the LÃ¶wchen's history as a companion to royalty who were under constant threat, he is a very alert fellow and reacts quickly to suspicious noise or activity. He should be taught as a young puppy that barking excessively at every sound or motion is not necessary nor appreciated. He lives to please his owner, which makes training fairly easy, so long as you use positive methods. He does not respond well to harsh correction."

Famous for their show-stopping, floor-length coat, Maltese are playful, charming, and adaptable toy companions.
Maltese are affectionate toy dogs weighing less than seven pounds, covered by a long, straight, silky coat. Beneath the all-white mantle is a compact body moving with a smooth and effortless gait. The overall picture depicts free-flowing elegance and balance. The irresistible Maltese face'¿with its big, dark eyes and black gumdrop nose'¿can conquer the most jaded sensibility.



 Despite their aristocratic bearing, Maltese are hardy and adaptable pets. They make alert watchdogs who are fearless in a charming toy-dog way, and they are game little athletes on the agility course. Maltese are low-shedding, long-lived, and happy to make new friends of all ages. Sometimes stubborn and willful, they respond well to rewards-based training.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Maltese is a healthy breed with few health issues, and will usually live well into the double digits. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as luxating patella and heart anomalies such as PDA (patent ductus arteriosus). It is recommended that Maltese puppies be bile-acid tested to rule out congenital liver issues such as liver shunt and microvascular dysplasia (MVD). There have been reported incidences of Maltese developing encephalitis (aka as GME). At this time, there is no screening test available. The American Maltese Association is working with researchers to come up with answers and perhaps a genetic test in the near future. As in all toy breeds, dental maintenance is important, and Maltese should have their teeth brushed daily with a toothpaste specially formulated for dogs, as well as routine cleanings at the vet.","The long, white coat of the Maltese is eye-catching and glorious. It requires daily gentle brushing and combing to the skin to prevent mats and tangles. Maltese should also have regular baths and coat conditioning to keep their hair looking its best. They have fast-growing nails that should be trimmed regularly. Check their ears weekly, and remove any excess hair or wax and any accumulated debris. Because Maltese are prone to dental disease as they get older, their teeth should be brushed frequently'¿ideally each time their coat is brushed. If the dog has excessive tear-staining around the eyes , a visit to the veterinarian to determine a possible cause is recommended.","Maltese are full of energy but require only occasional exercise to keep them healthy and happy. Daily walks with their owner or bouncing around in their fenced yard, or even indoors, will usually suffice to keep them fit.","Maltese are very intelligent, and in centuries of being companions to humans they have learned how to get exactly what they want from their people. It is important to be consistent with their training. Maltese are athletic and talented and make a fun choice as competitive companions in dog sports such as obedience or agility. They can be stubborn and determined, but they respond well to positive training methods."

A massive, heavy-boned dog of courage and prodigious strength, the Mastiff is docile and dignified but also a formidable protector of those they hold dear.
For the uninitiated, a face-to-face encounter with these black-masked giants can be startling. A male stands at least 30 inches at the shoulder and can outweigh many a full-grown man. The rectangular body is deep and thickly muscled, covered by a short double coat of fawn, apricot, or brindle stripes. The head is broad and massive, and a wrinkled forehead accentuates an alert, kindly expression. Mastiffs are patient, lovable companions and guardians who take best to gentle training. Eternally loyal Mastiffs are protective of family, and a natural wariness of strangers makes early training and socialization essential. Mastiffs are magnificent pets, but acquiring a powerful giant-breed dog is commitment not to be taken lightly.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Mastiff Club of America (MCOA)  provides in-depth information on breed health. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as seasonal allergies, eye anomalies, heart disease, cancer, eye and hip dysplasia, von Willebrand's disease, degenerative myelopathy, and epilepsy. Hygromas'¿harmless natural 'cushions' that protect the elbow joints when the Mastiff is lying on hard surfaces'¿are common. Do not allow the vet to drain them. Finally, Mastiffs can experience bloat, a life-threatening condition where the stomach suddenly distends and often twists as well. Owners should educate themselves as to what symptoms indicate this is occurring and what to do should it occur.","The Mastiff's short, dense coat is easy to groom, usually requiring only a quick brushing every few days. During periods of heavy shedding once or twice a year, more frequent sessions with a strong, toothed comb are recommended to remove dead hair. The ears and the deep wrinkles around the Mastiff's head, eyes, and muzzle should be regularly inspected and cleaned, and the nails trimmed short. Finally, Mastiffs drool! Most owners keep cloths at hand to wipe 'slingers' off their Mastiff's face and their own and visitors' clothing.","Bred to be guardians of 'hearth and home,' Mastiffs have comparatively low exercise requirements and can live happily in an apartment. They benefit physically and psychologically from free play and daily walks'¿a mile or two for adult Mastiffs. However, owners must be careful not to overtax growing puppies and young adults: Don't allow them to run up and down stairs, jump from heights, or engage in long walks. Begin with no more than half a block for a 2- to 3-month-old puppy. Additionally, Mastiffs are notorious for plopping down during walks when they are tired or overheated. Therefore, a rule of thumb is to not walk them farther than you can carry them back!","Obedience training and early socialization are 'musts' for Mastiffs. Mastiffs learn quickly and want to please. However, the repetitions in a typical training class will quickly bore them, at which point they may lie down, snoring. Make eye contact with your Mastiff; they communicate a great deal with their eyes, and they are excellent at reading your expressions and body language. Use praise and positive rewards'¿you can easily hurt their feelings by raising your voice. Hold several short sessions during the day, keeping it fun and varied. When treated with love, inclusion, and respect, Mastiffs can be trained to excel in almost any sphere."

The breed sheds a fair amount, even more so during shedding season, which can occur once or twice a year. Weekly brushing'¿daily during shedding season'¿will help to remove dirt and loose hairs and keep the dog looking his best. Mats or tangles can be worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.","Miniature American Shepherds are active and athletic, and they need a moderate amount of exercise but are also very adaptable to their family's way of life.

The Miniature Bull Terrier Club of America requires breeder-members to test all breeding stock and puppies. Any responsible breeder should belong to the breed club and adhere to their rules.","The Miniature Bull Terrier doesn't require a lot of grooming beyond regular baths and a weekly once-over with a soft brush or hound glove. The breed's strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly using a nail clipper or grinder to avoid splitting and cracking of an overgrown nail. Their ears should be checked routinely to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly and should also receive periodic cleanings from your veterinarian.","Exercising an MBT can be tricky. They require enough exercise as puppies to stay in good condition and keep good muscle tone, yet they can be prone to 'sudden lameness.' This is from a combination of weight and density of the muscle, rapid growth rate, and the breed's very character, which keeps them in almost constant motion. Often their joints simply can't handle the excesses until the dog is fully matured. For that reason, exercise of an MBT puppy should be kept at a minimum. Never allow them to jump up and down from heights or make sudden stops at high speeds.","Typical terriers, Mini Bulls require a trainer with a firm hand and a gentle voice, as well as lots of patience and a great sense of humor. MBTs are highly intelligent, curious, and independent, although they do love to please their human once they know what you want. Many owners of Mini Bulls suggest clicker training. Whatever method you use, keep your tone positive, and be sure to keep training sessions light and fun to hold your MBT's attention. Early socialization is a must."

The breed benefits from having a fenced area where they can run and chase a ball safely and enjoy playtime with their owner. Their greatest joy is to be with their family and doing activities together. Miniature Schnauzers have a strong prey drive, so they should never be allowed off leash when not in a fenced area, as they might not resist the urge to chase after small animals.","Miniature Schnauzers are friendly, lively, and eager to please, and they learn quickly.

He is a true working breed and shines when herding both cattle and sheep, and has found fame as a search and rescue dog in both Finland and the U.S.

","The Mudi is an overall healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen their stock for various health conditions. The Mudi Club of America has recommended testing listed on the CHIC website: caninehealthinfo.org","The Mudi is an easily cared for breed. Occasional baths, a combing or bushing to remove dead hair, and regular nail care are sufficient for this wash-and-wear breed.","Mudi are very energetic dogs. Though they are calm and relaxed in the house, once outside they appreciate a good run. Not surprisingly, a Mudi excels at flyball, obedience, herding, and frisbee. They are quite playful and can be mischievous, particularly when it comes to digging. They are also noted for their extraordinary jumping ability. A well-exercised Mudi is a Mudi who tends not to find trouble elsewhere.","The Mudi is vocal, alert, energetic, intelligent, biddable, adaptable, and always enthusiastic about any job that needs to be done. Needless to say, these traits make them very trainable and eager to please. The Mudi is also sensibly suspicious and, therefore, an excellent watchdog."

Wary with strangers, the profusely wrinkled Mastino is sweet, placid, and steady among loved ones.
Unless you've been to Jurassic Park, you've never seen anything like a Mastino. These majestic guardians of startling appearance are massive, powerful dogs. The U.S. Neapolitan Mastiff Club describes their dog's head as 'astounding''¿and give them credit for hitting upon just the right adjective. The profuse hanging wrinkles and folds, and pendulous lips, make a Mastino look like a marzipan Mastiff that's been out in the sun too long. And yet, the breed's inner dignity and nobility can only be described as beautiful.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Neapolitans are generally hardy dogs. One minor problem that often occurs is ""cherry eye,"" where tissue in the corner of the eye becomes red and inflamed. In the vast majority of cases, there is no permanent damage. Despite the breed's impressive wrinkles and loose skin, most do not have skin problems. There are health problems that are common in giant dogs to which the breed is not immune. Bloat is a sudden, life-threatening condition that can affect all deep-chested dogs. Its causes are not fully understood, but owners should learn the signs that bloat is occurring and know what action to take. As with all breeds, the Mastino can also develop hip dysplasia. It is important to discuss any health concerns with the dog's breeder and veterinarian.","The Neapolitan Mastiff is a short-coated breed, so in general a bath now and again is about all you need. The eyes and ears should be checked and gently cleaned whenever necessary with a damp cloth or paper towel. You will find that you will need to keep a towel handy to dry the face and lips (and yourself!), especially after the dog eats or drinks. Nails should be kept short.","Every dog should have the opportunity to run and romp often, but don't emphasize the running and quick turning, as joints can be easily damaged. This is a big, heavily built breed that overheats easily, so be careful in warm weather. The Neo puppy may want to play beyond when he should, so it is up to the owner to stop before the puppy gets too tired. Be careful about letting him go up and down stairs'¿many an exuberant puppy's knee has been injured by a leap off a porch or a jump down those last few stairs. Breed experts do not recommend lots of tug-of-war games or violent wrestling, since the growing Mastino will quickly learn he is stronger than his smaller human friend and think that he no longer needs to listen.","While most adults of the breed are calm animals who sleep a lot, Neapolitan puppies are as active, curious, cute, and cuddly as the most winsome toy puppy. And many people find that the adolescent Neapolitan, when awake, is an energetic, powerful animal. It is important to train the Mastino when he is young, so that when dealing with the strong, stubborn teenage personality stage, the appropriate hierarchy is already in place. By the age of 3 or 4, most Neapolitans demonstrate desirable laidback adult-type behavior. Neapolitans do not respond well to harsh training, and need an encouraging and rewarding atmosphere. Be patient and consistent."

The breed is faithful, easy-going and friendly in the home. Outdoors he is a true sporting dog being keen, swift, tough, attentive and energetic. With sufficient perseverance and stamina, he enjoys working and does so with a cheerful character.
The Kooikerhondje (Koi-ker-hond-yuh)'the 'little white and orange dog with a big heart' is a sporty, eye-catching fellow with a silky all-weather coat of white with red patches. They are instantly recognizable thanks to their large, black-tipped ears and the richly feathered tail they wag proudly. The breed has the sturdy bone structure expected of a serious hunter, but the overall picture is that of a harmoniously built dog of smooth, flowing contours and springy gait. The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje Club of the United States has served as the AKC Parent Club to represent the Kooikerhondje since April 2014.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Kooikerhondje is a relatively healthy breed living a long life. Originating from a very limited founding population, the Kooikerhondje is susceptible to various hereditary conditions. Utilization of proper breeding practices to reduce the coefficients of inbreeding is recommended to promote genetic diversity within the limited gene pool. Knowledge of genetic lines of disease within the breed combined with good breeding practices reduces serious illnesses within the Kooikerhondje. Even with applicant of good breeding practices, the Kooikerhondje can suffer from a variety of canine diseases. Current health concerns in regards to the breed include the following: 1. Polymyositis (PMN) 2. Renal disorders 3. Epilepsy","Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","A clever, lively, cheerful, devoted, sweet companion in the home and an athletic, driven, eager, busy explorer outdoors.","The Kooikerhondje is a cheerful, intelligent and lively but not hyper companion. The nature of the historic work for this small sporting breed means that they have prey drive and energy along with the sensitive character of a spaniel. They can be very determined, and are best trained with a firm attitude and gentle methods. The cheerful personality, athletic build, intelligence, and eager-to-please attitude makes the Kooikerhondje a highly trainable dog.  However, their drive and determination means that they do need that gentle training to fulfill their promise as charming household pets and sporting companions."

The sweet-tempered Newfie is a famously good companion and has earned a reputation as a patient and watchful 'nanny dog' for kids.
A male Newfoundland can weigh up to 150 pounds and stand 28 inches at the shoulder; females typically go 100 to 120 pounds. The Newf head is majestic, the expression soft and soulful. The outer coat is flat and coarse. Colors are gray, brown, black, and a black-and-white coat named for artist Sir Edwin Landseer, who popularized the look in his paintings.



 The Newfie breed standard says that a sweet temperament is the 'most important single characteristic of the breed.' The Newf's sterling character is expressed in their affinity for kids. Trusting and trainable, Newfs respond well to gentle guidance. These noble giants are among the world's biggest dogs, and acquiring a pet that could outweigh you comes with obvious challenges.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, cardiac disease, and cystinuria, which can cause stones to form in the urinary system. As with all drop-eared dogs, a Newf's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection","The Newfoundland's heavy coat requires thorough brushing at least once a week. A thorough going-over with a slicker brush and a long-toothed comb will remove dead hair and prevent mats from forming. These will become daily sessions during shedding season, which generally occurs twice a year; however, spayed and neutered Newfs shed year-round and will probably need to be brushed out several times a week. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause discomfort and structural problems.","The Newfoundland is a multipurpose dog, at home on land and in water. As well as being a devoted companion, he is adept at draft work and has natural lifesaving abilities. Newfoundlands need at least a half-hour of moderate exercise daily to stay healthy and happy. While they are definitely meant to live indoors with their human family, Newfs enjoy outdoor activities, especially swimming, and make great companions on long walks or hikes. Newfs enjoy pulling a cart, and some even participate in carting and drafting competitions. Other canine activities in which Newfs participate and excel include agility, dock jumping, flyball, herding, obedience, rally, and tracking.","The Newfoundland puppy is outgoing, intelligent, and curious'¿never timid, skittish, or aggressive. Daily human contact is absolutely essential for any Newfie. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Newfoundland grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. A puppy who is going to be trained for water work should be carefully introduced to water by the age of 4 months. Newfs are eager to please and generally easy to train. They are also affectionate and trusting; they respond well to gentle guidance but don't respond well to harsh corrections or training methods."

Norfolk Terriers are among the smallest working terriers, standing no higher than 10 inches at the shoulder. The coat is hard, wiry, and straight. They share many traits with their close cousins, Norwich Terriers. To tell them apart, look at the ears: The Norwich has erect, pointed ears; Norfolk ears are neatly folded over.



 Bred to work in packs, Norfolks are more gregarious than a typical terrier, but they have plenty of the old terrier pep. Few Norfolks these days earn their living hunting rodents, but a good one will fearlessly do so when given a chance. Norfolks bond closely, sometimes jealously, with their owners and make nice watchdogs. They have a reputation as a good traveler: portable, adaptable, and up for anything.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Norfolk Terriers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders test their stock for health conditions such as heart and eye issues and patellar luxation. A Norfolk's teeth should be brushed often using a toothpaste formulated for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure your dog will have a long, healthy life.","A Norfolk Terrier should have a double coat consisting of a hard outer coat and a soft undercoat that insulates the body from heat and cold. Hand-stripping removes old outer hairs and excess undercoat so that new hair can grow in. Wire coats that are cared for properly by hand-stripping have a beautiful shine and rich color. Learning to hand-strip, or finding a groomer who will hand-strip, is an important consideration in choosing this breed.","Long walks, socializing, and games of fetch with his owner will expend some of the Norfolk's boundless energy. With his active nature and extremely high prey drive, the Norfolk should be on leash while on outings, and his yard should be fenced.","Created to hunt in packs, Norfolks are geared to be more gregarious than the typical independent terrier. They are very smart and bond closely with their families, but they may challenge their owner's limits, so obedience training is a must. They have a very strong prey drive and pose a danger to small pets in the home, such as ferrets and hamsters. For this reason they should not be allowed off leash in areas that are not securely fenced. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended to ensure that the dog grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion.

Alert with head carried high, they have a fearless attitude and are extremely agile. They are calm, keen, and attentive, with a kind disposition.
Nobs aren't large dogs (a big male stands a shade below 20 inches) but their tough, sinewy bodies are built to withstand punishing terrain and harsh climates. They are a small-sized hunting dog of Spitz-type, which was thought to be extinct but survived as a farm and hunting dog in the Northern parts of Sweden and Finland. To be able to navigate the rough terrain and climate of the Scandinavian forests and hold large dangerous game, like moose, Norrbottenspets evolved to be extremely agile, rugged, and weatherproof with a fearless attitude, while at the same time kind and affectionate companions at home. They exhibit no extremes in physical characteristics because they must do all things well.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Some dogs may be faced with health challenges in their lives, but the majority of Norrbottenspets are healthy dogs. Working with a responsible breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed.","The Norrbottenspets is double-coated with a topcoat that is hard, short, and straight and an undercoat that is fine and dense. They are very clever and clean dogs, with no offensive smell. Beyond regular weekly grooming, the very occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Their nails should be trimmed when necessary with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed when needed.","Nobs are vivacious, energetic, and playful, with an engaging and affectionate disposition. Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience, and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.",

As family dogs, Buhunds are smart, affectionate, and steadfastly devoted.
The Buhund, a prototypical spitz, provides a good opportunity to explain the term. Spitz are cold-weather breeds characterized by a dense coat, a tail curved tightly over the back, a wedge-shaped head, and erect, pointed ears ('spitz' means 'pointed' in ancient German). They can be pint-sized like Pomeranians, mighty like Malamutes, or mid-sized like the lithe but sturdy Buhund. Males can stand 18.5 inches high and weight up to 40 pounds. Coat colors are wheaten or black.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","In general, Norwegian Buhunds tend to be healthy and hardy. Responsible breeders screen their breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, von Willebrand's disease, and eye disease. Potential puppy buyers are always advised to confirm the health screening of the sire and dam.","Compared to other breeds, Norwegian Buhunds do not need extensive grooming. They are naturally clean and basically odorless dogs, even when wet. The Buhund has a double coat: an outer coat that is thick, rich, hard, and smooth lying, and a soft, dense, and woolly undercoat. The coat sheds most foreign substances with ease, and dries itself after a bath. Buhunds do need to be brushed two to three times a week, and more often during the shedding season'¿like other double-coated dogs, Buhunds blow their undercoats once or twice a year. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly.","Buhunds have been bred to work and herd for hours at a time. This can result in very energetic dogs who need vigorous exercise (that allows them to run fast) twice a day for optimum physical and mental health. These dogs love to run with a bicycle, retrieve balls, or go for long, all-day hikes. The breed can also exercise mind and body by participating in obedience, tracking, agility, and other activities that dog and owner can enjoy together.","Compared to other Spitz and Northern breeds, Norwegian Buhunds are easier to train, but they still retain the independent characteristics of such breeds. Buhunds do have a desire to please, but their independence is often stronger, which makes it challenging to maintain their focus and convince them to continue training. Fortunately most Buhunds are highly food-motivated, therefore positive-training techniques such as clicker training work well. At the same time, most Buhunds are extremely sensitive to their environment, which makes them challenging in the dog-show ring."

The durable Elkhound is among Europe's oldest dogs. They sailed with the Vikings and figure in Norse art and legend.
Norwegian Elkhounds are hardy, short-bodied dogs standing about 20 inches at the shoulder. They have a dense silver-gray coat and a tail curling tightly over the back. The deep chest, sturdy legs, and muscular thighs belong to a dog built for an honest day's work. The eyes are a dark brown and the ears mobile and erect. Overall, an Elkhound is the picture of an alert and steadfast dog of the north.



 Elkhounds are famously fine companions and intelligent watchdogs. Agility and herding trials are good outlets for their natural athleticism and eagerness. Reserved until introductions are made, an Elkhound is a trustworthy friend ever after. These strong, confident dogs are truly sensitive souls, with a dash of houndy independence.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","By and large this is a very healthy breed. The average life span is 12'¿14 years, with most owners losing their dogs due to cancer or heart issues. Negligible incidences of PRA have been found but can be traced to foreign dogs. hip dysplasia occurs, but by and large dogs that are checked usually get a 'good' or 'fair' evaluation from OFA, with many rating 'excellent.' There have been some bouts of renal (kidney) issues, but this seems to have been put out of the breed's current state of health.","The Norwegian Elkhound has a 'two-ply' coat, with a top coat and an undercoat. Elkhound breeders warn potential puppy buyers of the inevitable'¿that during shedding season they will have 'tumbleweeds' of silver undercoat rolling around their house. The outer coat will shed as well, but not to the degree that the undercoat will. A slicker brush will help you keep the fur storm under control. Five minutes a day of 'back-brushing' (brushing in the opposite direction to which the coat lies) will take care of the problem for most of the year. Daily maintenance of just two minutes a day at other times will keep the coat beautiful, and will give your vacuum a new lease on life! Elkhounds do not have a doggy smell, due to the harshness of the coat. A bath two to three times a year for the family pet is perfect and helps the dead coat to fall out and new, healthy hair to grow in.","These are hunting dogs in their native Norway. They track and follow moose, ranging far ahead of the hunter, and they must be able to trot many miles for several days if necessary. Because they must make their own decisions when hunting, and by virtue of the way they hunt, they are independent and lovers of the woods and their freedom. For that reason, when exercising their Norwegian Elkhounds, owners should resist the temptation to allow them to roam the neighborhood or the park off lead. The instinct to travel and to inspect the world is intrinsic to the breed. Most love swimming (a required moose-trailing activity), and many enjoy agility as well as herding trials.","This breed does not tend to be a star performer in the obedience ring. The Elkhound learns very quickly, being highly intelligent, but after this learning process it becomes, 'Didn't we already do this 12 times?' The other difficulty in training this breed for activities is their independent nature, inspired by their hunting traits. As far as simple house manners, they are very clean and quickly respond to correctly managed housebreaking."

With puffins now a protected species, today's Lundehund is a friendly, athletic companion.
At a glance, Lundehunds seem a typical northern breed: A spitz type with triangular ears, curving tail, and a dense double coat. But a closer look reveals several unique traits. They have feet with at least six fully functioning toes and extra paw pads, an 'elastic neck' that can crane back so the head touches the spine, ears that fold shut, and flexible shoulders that allow forelegs to extend to the side, perpendicular to the body. This last anomaly produces the breed's distinctive 'rotary' gait.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

He will enjoy a brisk, 30-minute walk or a couple of ball-chasing sessions with his owner every day.","The Lundehund is very sensitive and can develop trust issues, and harsh training methods should never be used. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the dog grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion.

Norwiches are toy-sized but are not satin-pillow dogs'¿they were originally bred as tough and fearless ratters. They are distinguished from their doggy doppelganger, the Norfolk Terrier, by their erect, pointed ears.



 Happy-go-lucky, fearless, and sometimes even bossy, Norwiches are energetic enough to play fetch all day, but affectionate enough to enjoy hours of lap time with their favorite human. Short, positive training sessions work best with this clever but sometimes stubborn breed.

","Overall, Norwich Terriers are a healthy breed. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, epilepsy, degenerative myelopathy, and upper airway syndrome, a respiratory condition that is quite variable, and its prevalence and mode of inheritance are poorly understood. Norwich are prone to developing plaque and tartar, so diligent  dental care is essential.","A Norwich Terrier should have a double coat consisting of a harsh, nearly weatherproof outer coat, and a soft undercoat that insulates the body from heat and cold. Hand-stripping removes old outer hairs and excess undercoat so that new hair grows in. Wire coats that are cared for properly by hand-stripping have a beautiful shine and rich colors. Because clipping or scissoring cuts the colored tips off, the natural color will fade, and the texture will soften. The breed requires regular grooming. Learning to hand-strip, or finding a groomer who will hand-strip, is an important consideration in choosing this breed.","The Norwich retains its original hunting instincts and jovial temperament. They are inquisitive and energetic, and they should be in fit condition for the day's activities. They require ample exercise to benefit their mental and physical health. Because of their innate hunting instincts, they must be walked on a leash or let out only in a securely fenced area.","Norwich are spirited little terriers, and they are usually eager to please and respond well to training.

Play fetch with a tireless Toller until your right arm falls off, and he will ask you to throw left-handed.
The little gundog with the big name is the smallest AKC retriever, standing ideally 18 or 19 inches at the shoulder. The Toller's trademark is a coat of stunning crimson, ranging from golden red to a dark coppery color, with white markings. Strong and agile, Tollers are medium dogs: medium in size, bone, and coat length. The almond-shaped eyes project an alert expression.



 Tollers are upbeat athletes who require outlets for their boundless vigor: hunting, hiking, camping, and, of course, swimming (for which they are ideally suited, down to their webbed feet). Tollers are smart, handsome, affectionate companions, but these red tornadoes can be recommended only to those with enough time and energy to keep them usefully occupied.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

Health concerns in the breed include Addison's disease, which often doesn't surface until the dog is middle-aged, the dog may have already produced offspring by the time a diagnosis is made. Efforts to develop a gene-marker test have been unsuccessful so far. Tollers also are somewhat more prone than other breeds to develop autoimmune-related issues.","Tollers require weekly brushing to keep their coat looking its best. During shedding season, daily brushing is often in order. Pay special attention to the coat around and under the ears, as in these areas it is finer and more likely to knot. Because Tollers should be presented as naturally as possible, minimal additional grooming is preferred, and this is generally limited to neatening the areas around the ears and feet. Special care should be taken to remove excess hair from between the pads of the feet, as this will help your Toller maintain traction on indoor surfaces. Attention should also be paid to trimming nails, preferably weekly.","Most Tollers have a medium to high energy level and are not generally content unless they are able to engage in some form of physical exercise on a daily basis. A brisk, 30-minute walk and/or a couple of ball-chasing sessions per day will suffice for many Tollers, though some will need more. Because Tollers love to engage and do things with their owners, many owners participate in canine sports such as agility, flyball, or fieldwork to channel the breed's excess energy. Engaging in these sports has the added benefit of strengthening the bond between owner and Toller.","Temperament-wise, Tollers are often a curious mixture of stubborn and soft. At times they seem to have the brain of a Chessie and the heart of a spaniel. These characteristics can make them challenging to train, as you don't always know whether they are 'putting one on over you.' Most Tollers respond well to reward-based training. They generally want to know what's in it for them and enjoy 'learn to earn' opportunities. They like training to be fun, so short, productive sessions are best. However, it is still important to have consequences for undesirable responses. As one Toller owner put it, 'You don't want them to think they are living on a cruise ship.'"

The OES is a big, agile dog who enjoys exploring and a good romp.
Beneath the Old English Sheepdog's profuse double coat is a muscular and compact drover, with plenty of bone and a big rump, standing 21 or 22 inches at the shoulder. Their eyes (when you can see them) are dark brown, or blue, or one of each. The OES breed standard says the skull is 'capacious and rather squarely formed, giving plenty of room for brain power.' OES move with a bear-like shuffle but are famous for their nimbleness afoot. Regular exercise is required for these strong, able-bodied workers. Equally famed are their many fine housedog qualities: watchfulness, courage, kindliness, and intelligence. Great with children, OES make patient, protective playmates. They are sensible watchdogs known for a loud, ringing bark.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, eye conditions (PRA and hereditary cataracts), autoimmune thyroiditis, cardiac anomalies, and hereditary deafness. Fortunately, DNA tests now exist for cerebellar ataxia and primary ciliary dyskinesia, two deadly diseases that breeders can avoid producing simply by identifying carriers and not breeding them to other carriers. DNA tests are also available for drug sensitivity and exercise-induced collapse.","The coat is what attracts most people to the Old English Sheepdog. The breed is double-coated and requires a thorough grooming down to the skin, over the entire dog, at least weekly to maintain their full coats. ""Puppy trims"" are good options for pet dogs, but they also require regular brushing between baths and haircuts. Keeping the feet clipped ('Poodle feet') will minimize problems and cleanup. Potential owners need to be prepared to spend the time required to do this, or pay a professional groomer, for several sessions each month for the life of the dog. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly.","This is a breed that requires some physical activity. There is a wide variance in the activity levels, but all require some regular exercise. Fortunately, they do have an ""off switch' when they come indoors.","One longtime breeder advises, ""Never allow your puppy to do something that you would not want a large, shaggy, wet, possibly muddy dog doing in your house."" All OES puppies are adorable, and all grow up to be large, shaggy dogs. Most Old English Sheepdogs are quite intelligent and have a biddable nature. After they learn something, they do not forget it. They do get bored with repetitive, robotic training exercises. If you want to participate in some of those activities, you need to change things up and make it new and fun. As with all dogs, early socialization in puppyhood is vital."

This scarce breed is known for his dense shaggy coat, webbed feet, acute sense of smell, and affinity for swimming.
These big, bouncy hounds were ideally suited for otter hunting. OHs are built to be expert swimmers, from the top of their rough, waterproof coat to the bottom of their big webbed feet. A broad chest and powerful shoulders allow them to swim all day without tiring. Their large black nose is amazingly sensitive and could follow an otter's underwater scent trail over great distances. And the OH's size and strength enabled them to take on a sharp-toothed, razor-clawed otter that might weigh 20 pounds.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Otterhounds are healthy for a large breed, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as epilepsy and hip dysplasia, though even dogs with moderate hip dysplasia on radiographs may move very well for their entire lives. Like all large dogs, Otterhounds can experience bloat, a life-threatening condition where the stomach enlarges and sometimes twists. Owners should educate themselves about the signs of bloat and the action to take should it occur.","While Otterhounds should be shown as naturally as possible, their coats do need brushing once or twice a week, depending on length and texture. A good slicker brush and medium comb work for this. The Otterhound's beard may need cleaning at the same time, since the dogs tend to drag them on the ground and store snacks in them. Nails should be trimmed every week or two.","Otterhounds need mental as well as physical exercise. A large, securely fenced yard is a good beginning, but some hounds will lie under a tree in a fenced acre rather than self-exercise. Long walks to sniff the world and visit passersby are good for both owners and hounds. Obedience classes, tracking, and agility all provide mental stimulation as well as good exercise.","As large and strong as Otterhounds are, they can be very sensitive. Use positive, reward-based training methods and praise to get the best results. Like people, Otterhounds love to be told how wonderful and talented they are when they master something. Be patient. Food usually works well in training, but the combination of food and praise together is even better. Clicker training can also work well with Otterhounds."

Despite his refined appearance, the Pap is truly a 'doggy dog' blessed with a hardy constitution. Papillon fanciers describe their breed as happy, alert, and friendly.
A tiny dog, measuring 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder, you can still spot a Papillon a block away thanks to the large, wing-shaped ears that give the breed its name ('papillon' is French for 'butterfly'). Some Paps have erect ears; in others, known as the Phalene type, the ears are down. Paps are dainty and elegant, with a plumed tail, and a long, silky coat of several color combinations, the base color being white. More robust than they look, Paps are little dogs for all seasons and reasons. They thrive in warm or cool climates, in town or country, and are eager to join family fun. They are excellent agility dogs and are consistent winners at the sport's highest levels; less ambitious owners can train them to do all kinds of tricks.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Papillons are tough and gutsy, but they are very small. Owners need to be careful with them, especially when they are puppies, around stairs, furniture, and other, larger animals. A small child can accidentally hurt his puppy friend very easily. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as a fontanel in the top of the skull, similar to a human baby's soft spot; and patellar luxation, or kneecaps that can ""slip"" or dislocate, sometimes briefly, sometimes completely.","For a breed with long, silky hair, Papillons needs surprisingly little grooming, mostly because they do not have an undercoat. Grooming every month or so is fine. Between full grooming sessions, you might want to spend a few minutes running a comb or soft slicker brush through the hair inside the hind legs, behind the ears, and on the ""culottes,"" or thigh hair, as mats tend to form there. A Papillon will need a bath every few months, or when he or she gets especially muddy or dirty. The Papillon's nails grow quickly and should be trimmed regularly'¿especially the dewclaw, which can curl around and pierce the leg. Finally, regular tooth brushing is vital for dental health.","Thanks to their small size, Papillons make wonderful indoor pets, but that doesn't mean they don't need exercise. They are active, smart dogs, and they will want their people to play with them. Indoors, they enjoy retrieving a small ball or toy'¿a Papillon will quickly learn to bring it back so you can throw it again. Outdoors, true to their spaniel heritage, Papillons will happily run in the yard to chase after squirrels, chipmunks, and even insects. Papillons tend not to realize how small they actually are, so owners need to watch carefully if they set out after a larger dog, or even a cat.","Papillons are intelligent and eager to please the humans they have bonded with. Generally speaking, some small breeds can take a little longer to housetrain than large breeds do, but Papillons make the process easier. Early socializationis very important, and obedience classes are a good idea'¿your Papillon will learn to do what you tell him to, and you will learn not to overindulge your adorable companion. And remember that the Papillon is a companion dog at heart; they may be unhappy and develop undesirable behaviors if left left alone for long periods of time. Fortunately, a Papillon can bond with other pets as well as humans."

Puppy buyers should always as for certification of screenings performed on a litter's sire and dam.","The Parson Russell Terrier has two coat types: smooth and broken (rough). Both require regular brushing'¿the smooth with a thick brush or hound glove, and the rough with a pin or slicker brush. Rough coats will require plucking or clipping to avoid matting of the longer hairs. A monthly bath should be sufficient, unless the Parson follows his nature and ends up digging in the mud. The Parson's nails should be trimmed monthly and his ears checked weekly for debris or excess wax, and cleaned as needed.","Parson Russell Terriers are playful, affectionate, fun-loving companions. They have a great zest for life and are always ready to join in activities. They are also high-energy terriers with powerful hunting instincts'¿with their strong prey drive, keeping them on leash during outings is recommended, rather than letting them run loose, where the urge to go off on a chase may be irresistible. An ideal day for a pet Parson would include a long walk in the woods, where he could explore every hole and sniff every tree trunk. Exercise can also consist of play sessions in the backyard. A Parson is the dog for someone who is fairly active. He will not be satisfied to lie alone in the corner for long periods of time.","Training the Parson Russell Terrier requires consistency, a gentle voice, and a great sense of humor. Smart, energetic, happy-go-lucky little dogs, they get bored easily, so training sessions must be kept fun and interesting.

These are sophisticated dogs of undying loyalty and many subtle delights.
Pekingese are compact, stocky toy dogs weighing up to 14 pounds. The coat is longest at the neck and shoulders, giving Pekes their famous 'lion's mane.' Coats come in various reds, from a golden-red to darker shades. The large, short-muzzled head is a wider-than-long 'envelope shaped' rectangle, and the eyes are large, dark, and sparkly. A unique feature of Pekes is their effortless 'rolling' gait.



 Pekes are charming, confident companions who develop a tight bond with their favorite human. Bred to live in palaces, they can be as serenely independent as the emperors who owned them. (They're 'opinionated,' Peke people say.) Ever alert, they make good watchdogs.

They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","As with all short-faced breeds, it is important to choose a Pekingese with wide-open nostrils on a moderate-sized nose. Because Pekingese don't have a long muzzle to act as a natural barrier of protection for the eyes, it is important to ensure that your environment is safe for your Peke and that nothing can jab or irritate his eyes. Pekingese appreciate cold temperatures, and therefore some owners travel with their Pekes on frozen ice packs, or an ice pillow, even for rides in the car, which provides a level of comfort that Pekingese thoroughly enjoy. Working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Peke can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize health testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","The thick double coat of the Pekingese requires a good bit of maintenance. Pekingese shed seasonally. Brushing him at least one hour per week will help to remove loose hairs and prevent matting, and an occasional bath will help to keep him looking his best. Mats or tangles can be gently worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.","Pekingese are charming, confident companions who develop a close bond with their people. Their whole purpose in life is to amuse and comfort. Although they are fairly sedate most of the time and have only modest exercise requirements, they do enjoy participating in canine sports at their own pace.","A hallmark of the breed is their friendly, outgoing, loving personality. Pekes are affectionate and intelligent and develop very strong connections to their people. As dogs who for centuries lived in palaces, Pekes can be as serenely independent as the emperors who owned them. (They're 'opinionated,' Peke people often say.)

They are one the world's most popular herding breeds.
At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day's work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings.



 The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training. As herders bred to move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute senses and a 'big dog' bark.

","The Pembroke is typically a healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, eye disorders, cardiac issues, degenerative myelopathy, and von Willebrand's disease, a bleeding disorder. As with all breeds, a Pembroke's ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Pembroke has a thick, weatherproof double coat'¿a soft, light undercoat covered by a coarse outer coat. The breed sheds a fair amount on a daily basis, and even more so in the late spring/early summer. A daily once-over with a comb and a slicker brush will remove a lot of the shed hair before it is all over the house. During shedding season, baths help to loosen the dead hairs'¿the dog must be completely dry before brushing begins'¿and a rake helps strip out the undercoat. As with all breeds, the Corgi's nails should be trimmed regularly, and ears checked to be sure they are clean and healthy.","A strong, athletic little dog developed to herd cattle and other livestock, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi loves physical activity and is happiest when he has a job to do. Corgis benefit from moderate daily exercise to maintain their physical and mental health. Pembrokes can do well on long walks or slow jogs, but their short legs won't allow them to keep up with a bicycle rider. Avoid extreme heat or cold, and always provide plenty of cool, fresh water after exercise. Many Pembrokes enjoy and excel at canine activities such as agility, herding, obedience, and tracking events.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are strongly recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of 7 weeks and 4 months will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Pembrokes often have a mind of their own, but they are energetic, willing, and highly intelligent partners who respond well to training.

Going by his general conformation, it is an elegant and slim dog, whose aspect expresses speed, strength and harmony without ever appearing coarse. Another particular feature is that the dentition in the hairless variety is nearly always incomplete, associated with the congenital alopecia. Noble and affectionate at home with those close to him, he is at the same time lively and alert. He might be wary of strangers and is a good watch dog.

He must have plenty of room to wander and explore. The PBGV has an extraordinary sense of smell and an often irresistible urge to follow scents that interest him, so exercising him when outside of his yard should always be done on a leash, as he will be prone to follow his nose and ignore all else. He makes a good companion for a hiker, runner, or biker who enjoys an active partner on jaunts.","PBGVs have a reputation for being hard to train. In fact, they are very intelligent, but they tend to have a mind of their own. Socialization and obedience training should begin early and will teach the PBGV to be a good companion and canine citizen.

The most common cancers in the breed are hemangiosarcoma, and mast cell tumor and mammary cancer, though some of these conditions are likely age related and afflict all dogs, regardless of breed or mix. 'Looking at the results, I can say with confidence that the Pharaoh Hound is not plagued with any significant disorders,' Dr. Sipperly says.","Pharaoh Hounds do not require a great deal of grooming. Daily light brushing or a heavier weekly brushing will do, with baths given as necessary. Particular attention should be paid to keeping the ears clean, and keeping the nails trimmed short enough that they do not make a tapping sound when the dog walks across the floor. Teeth should be cleaned at home on a regular basis but also should be checked by your veterinarian when the dog has his yearly checkup. Pharaohs do not normally have a 'doggy odor,' so if an odor is present, check him to find the cause.","Anyone considering owning a Pharaoh must know that the breed does require a regular exercise schedule to keep happy and in good condition. If you are fortunate enough to have a 'self-runner,' just let him run 15 to 20 minutes twice a day. This requires a six-foot-high fenced-in area of about 50 feet by 50 feet, minimum. If this is not possible, or if he is not a natural 'runner,' be prepared to walk your Pharaoh for at least 20 minutes twice a day. No amount of training should be trusted to overcome the Pharaoh's strong hunting instinct. He should never be allowed to exercise off-lead in an unenclosed area.","The Pharaoh is quick to learn and eager to please. However, there is a problem in teaching him to come if he is off lead in an open area. It has been proven time and again that most Pharaohs, no matter how obedient or well trained, will not come when called when they find themselves suddenly in a 'free situation.' They will run off, happy to be hunting'¿with some dogs finally caught after several days, but others, sadly, killed in traffic, or gone forever."

This eye-catching scenthound is North Carolina's state dog.
The hound with the curious name (we'll get to that) and unique history (we'll get to that, too) is a streamlined, long-tailed, light-footed hunter standing as high as 25 inches at the shoulder. The flashy coat comes in an array of brindle-stripe patterns, from black flecked with gold to flaming orange and russet, in addition to some solid colors. The medium-length ears hang gracefully, and the leather of the nose, lips, and eye rims are black, setting off an inquisitive and confident expression.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Plotts are generally healthy dogs. A responsible breeder will have had the dog's parents screened for health concerns such as hip dysplasia. Pendant ears such as the Plott's can be prone to infection, so the ears should be checked regularly. The teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the Plott a long, healthy life.","The Plott's smooth, fine, glossy coat can be any shade of brindle (a streaked or striped pattern of dark hair imposed on a lighter background), solid black, or have a saddle or markings. It requires minimal maintenance, with just a weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush or a hound glove to remove dirt and loose hair. An occasional bath can help keep him from having a doggy odor. The Plott's ears should be regularly inspected for debris or excess wax and cleaned if needed with soft gauze and an ear-cleaning solution'¿the dog's breeder or the veterinarian can recommend a good brand to use. The nails should be trimmed often if not worn down naturally.","Plotts are tough, relentless athletes requiring lots of exercise and outdoor time. The breed's standard says: ""Noted for stamina, endurance, agility, determination, and aggressiveness when hunting, the powerful, well muscled, yet streamlined Plott combines courage with athletic ability."" Daily vigorous exercise such as long walks or runs or play sessions with his owner will help to keep the Plott mentally and physically healthy. Because the Plott is extremely prey driven, he should always be walked on leash.","The Plott is intelligent, alert, and confident. He can be a tail-wagging, people-loving dog, but may be a bit standoffish, since he is extremely smart and focused. Puppies should be socialized thoroughly with gentle exposure to a wide variety of people and other animals. Prospective owners should plan on an energetic puppy who requires a lot of attention. Because of his intelligence, the Plott needs mental stimulation to keep him occupied, or he will find ways to amuse himself that may be undesirable. Plotts may become food or toy aggressive, and need to be trained to avoid these behaviors. Owners should be prepared to hear the Plott's ""voice"" in the home at times."

The outer coat is crisp, with a water-resistant texture, and the undercoat is soft and dense. A PON kept in full coat will need to be thoroughly brushed at least once a week. A PON who is kept in a puppy or 'summer' clip will still need routine brushing to keep the coat free of mats and debris such as grass, weeds, and flower blooms. The ears will also need to be checked weekly and cleaned if needed, and the nails trimmed.","A high-energy, athletic dog, the PON needs ample exercise on a daily basis. At minimum, he should have a large, fenced-in yard to run around in for at least an hour or two daily. PONs bond closely with their owners and love to accompany them on long walks or hikes, or working with their human partner in canine events such as obedience, herding, agility trials, or dock diving.","PONs are excellent housedogs: accepting of other animals, gentle and tireless playmates for kids, alert watchdogs, and quick learners.

The glorious coat, smiling, foxy face, and vivacious personality have helped make the Pom one of the world's most popular toy breeds.
¿The Pomeranian combines a tiny body (no more than seven pounds) and a commanding big-dog demeanor. The abundant double coat, with its frill extending over the chest and shoulders, comes in almost two dozen colors, and various patterns and markings, but is most commonly seen in orange or red.



 Alert and intelligent, Pomeranians are easily trained and make fine watchdogs and perky pets for families with children old enough to know the difference between a toy dog and a toy. Poms are active but can be exercised with indoor play and short walks, so they are content in both the city and suburbs. They will master tricks and games with ease, though their favorite activity is providing laughs and companionship to their special human.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Pomeranians are generally healthy little dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as luxating patellas (kneecaps that slip out of place), hypothyroidism, collapsing tracheas, congestive heart failure, seizures, and alopecia X (black skin disease). The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) is a registry that keeps health-screening information in a public database. Be sure to request to see copies of OFA results of the litter's parents from the breeder when considering a puppy.","The Pomeranian's profuse double coat is one of his most distinguishing features. Frequent brushing is necessary to maintain the beautiful coat that we admire. Brush through the dog with a pin brush and a slicker brush down to the skin once a week to keep the hair from matting. Pomeranians are active dogs, so it is important that their nails are kept short. It is highly recommended that you find a groomer to do a full groom'¿including bath, brushing, ears, nails, and anal glands'¿every four to six weeks, if you are not comfortable with doing this at home. You should also pay close attention to the Pom's teeth. It is a good idea to brush the teeth during their weekly grooming session.","As much as Pomeranians enjoy being lapdogs and family companions, they do benefit from some exercise and enjoy the chance to run, play, and go for walks. Be sure to keep a close eye on your Pom when he or she is outside. They are notorious for escaping through small crevices or gaps in fencing, or climbing over short fencing. Small breeds like Pomeranians can be mistaken for rabbits or squirrels by large, predatory birds such as hawks and owls, so it is vital to keep a Pom under cover or stay with them at all times. When taking your Pom for a walk, be cautious of your surroundings. Other dogs who are not controlled can easily hurt your Pom.","The Pom should be trained to walk on a leash early on and taught to come when called. Housebreaking can be a challenge, so consistency and patience are key. It is important to keep your Pom from jumping on and off couches or beds, as they can injure joints or even break a bone. Poms are alert and highly intelligent, and they enjoy and can excel in canine activities like agility, rally, and obedience, or working as therapy dogs."

Elegant, proud, graceful, cat-like and stunningly gorgeous, the Porcelaine is never shy or timid and always eager for a pat on the head or a hug. His nature makes him an excellent candidate for medical therapy, medical alert, medical service, police public relations, and search and rescue. The Porcelaine is primarily a hunting dog breed, originating from a mixture of highly intelligent French and English scent hounds.

Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Despite Porcelaines being fierce hunters, they are gentle and relatively easy to handle. Because of their strong drive to follow their nose, they should have a fenced yard to run in. On walks, always have your Porcelaine on a leash when you're going outside or use a GPS tracking collar if working off leash. Very active dogs, Porcelaines need a lot of exercise, and so are not recommended for people who live in apartments. Options for exercise include play time in the fenced backyard or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience, and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.","Porcelaines prefer to be in a single-dog household and the sole object of your affection.

The Podengo is a rugged coursing hound that comes in two sizes: (medium, standing 16 to 22 inches at the shoulder) and (large, 22 to 28 inches). They also have two coat types: smooth and wirehaired. The breed's enthusiasts describe it as 'primitive,' that is, it's a rustic, no-frills hound untouched by fads and fashion since arriving on the Iberian Peninsula ages ago. Among their distinctive characteristics are large, erect, triangular ears; a pyramid-shaped head that tapers to the nose; and sweetly expressive, almond-shaped eyes. Podengos, in general, are funny dogs that love to play. They easily entertain themselves with toys, chase each other and stalk each other around the house and yard. They are highly intelligent and learn new things very fast. Since they are a watchful dog though, they are not as easy going and playful with strangers and may view smaller animals like dogs and cats as prey. They may be quite reserved initially and prefer to greet strangers on their own terms.

The U.S. parent club position has been one that favors testing for ""illumination rather than elimination.""","The wirehaired Podengos will shed in sections. It is important to brush regularly to remove dead hair. The smooth-coated dogs should require slightly less grooming; an occasional brushing will suffice. Neither coat should be stripped. Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Their nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Podengos are great watchdogs and companions. They are very playful and quick to learn, but not always easy to train. Both size varieties are respected as versatile hunters and companions who use all their senses, as well as their agility, speed, and endurance, running singly or in packs. The medium size is more intense and energetic than the large, who does enjoy relaxing on the couch.","Podengos will both surprise and test the unprepared owner. They require firm training or they will find their own adventures, but they are easily motivated by food and fun. To get the most enjoyment from your Podengo, raise the most relaxed and tolerant Podengo you can by taking him to training classes and provide as much early socialization as possible."

Pequenos love to run, romp, and chase when outdoors but make charming and well-mannered housemates.
The Pequeno is the smallest of Portugal's three Podengo breeds, standing 8 to 12 inches at the shoulder and weighing no more than 13 pounds. A distinctive feature is the wedge-shaped head, with expressive almond-shaped eyes and erect, pointed ears. The long-backed body is muscular, the tail tapered and sickle-shaped, and the coat either short and dense or long and wiry. The overall look is that of a rustic, no-nonsense rabbit dog unspoiled by passing fashions.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is a healthy breed overall. With a small gene pool in the States, breeders screen breeding stock to be able to identify and breed away from possible genetic issues .Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as eye disorders and joint diseases such as hip dysplasia or patellar luxation (slipped stifles). Overall, the majority of PPPs are healthy dogs with few genetic problems.","The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is a no-frills, wash-and-wear kind of dog who comes in two coat types: smooth and wire. Routine brushing followed by running a comb through the hair to eliminate any tangles in the wire coat, and an occasional wipe-down with a damp cloth on the smooth coat, will be sufficient to keep him in great shape between monthly baths. No clipping or scissoring is required. Starting a good dental-care program with regular brushing will alleviate the possibility of issues occurring later. Nails should be trimmed regularly using a nail clipper or grinder.","Bred originally for rabbit hunting, the energetic Portuguese Podengo Pequeno requires brisk daily exercise. They have a rightful reputation for being tough and tireless. Playing in a large fenced yard, a vigorous walk daily, participation in agility or obedience trials, or hunting can provide the needed activity. They should only be allowed loose within safely fenced areas'¿as hunters, their instinct to follow their nose can get them into trouble quite quickly.","The PPP is a very lively and intelligent little dog. They are quick learners, but training must be fun and given in short sessions. They relish any sort of training, and excel at almost anything you ask them to do. They are easily trained as hunters, in performance sports, and, despite their small stature, as watchdogs. So long as you keep your training sessions positive, you will end up with a dog who will be welcome in any situation."

","Portuguese Pointers are generally a very robust, healthy breed. There are no health issues specific to the breed, though care should be taken to ensure breeding dogs and their relatives are free of known health issues including seizures, hip dysplasia, and early-onset cancers or autoimmune diseases.","Portuguese Pointers require minimal grooming due to their short, tight coats, but they all seem to enjoy a nice brushing with a rubber curry-type brush anyway, which also helps remove dead hair. In general, their hard coat is good at repelling dirt, so frequent baths are not needed. Routine attention to nails, teeth, and ears is expected.","The Portuguese Pointer is a sporting dog and as such, enjoys running and hunting, even if it's just pointing butterflies in the backyard or running on a hike. As they do still retain very strong hunting instincts, off-lead, safe exercise is key to a happy dog, mentally and physically. Young dogs have quite a bit of energy, especially males, but the breed does very well living calmly as a house dog as long as they are allowed daily outdoor exercise.","The Portuguese Pointer is an extremely kind and devoted sporting dog.

He is known for his skillful ability to keep livestock in pastures and also for searching out stray animals. He is always vigilant and successfully alerts if predators are in the area. This breed is extremely devoted to its work and conducts it with joy and pleasure.
Portuguese Sheepdogs are medium-sized dogs with appreciable rusticity and sobriety and are extremely agile and swift. Their long hair has a goat-like texture, without an undercoat, and can be straight or slightly wavy. The dense and evenly-distributed coat forms a long beard, mustache, and eyebrows that are not so long as to cover his eyes. Coat colors can be yellow, brown, grey, fawn, wolf grey in shades ranging from light to dark, and black, accompanied by tan markings.

Pugs live to love and to be loved in return.
The Pug's motto is the Latin phrase 'multum in parvo' (a lot in a little)'¿an apt description of this small but muscular breed. They come in three colors: silver or apricot-fawn with a black face mask, or all black. The large round head, the big, sparkling eyes, and the wrinkled brow give Pugs a range of human-like expressions'¿surprise, happiness, curiosity'¿that have delighted owners for centuries.



 Pug owners say their breed is the ideal house dog. Pugs are happy in the city or country, with kids or old folks, as an only pet or in a pack. They enjoy their food, and care must be taken to keep them trim. They do best in moderate climates'¿not too hot, not too cold'¿but, with proper care, Pugs can be their adorable selves anywhere.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Pug's dark, appealing eyes are one of his main attractions, but also one of his vulnerable spots. Eye problems including corneal ulcers and dry eye have been known to occur. Like all flat-faced breeds, Pugs sometimes experience breathing problems and do poorly in sunny, hot, or humid weather. The website of the breed's parent club, the Pug Dog Club of America, offers detailed information on breed health.","The Pug's short, smooth, glossy coat needs minimal maintenance, but it does shed. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt, or a hound glove will help to remove the loose hair and help keep him looking his best. Pugs don't need to be bathed unless they happen to get into something particularly messy or start to get a doggy odor. The Pug's nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause him discomfort.","Given the opportunity, a Pug will happily spend much of the day snuggling on the sofa'¿which, combined with the breed's fondness for eating, makes obesity a real possibility. But the Pug is playful, sturdy, and lively, too, and owners can keep the breed fit with daily opportunities for moderate exercise, such as walks or play sessions in the yard. It's vital to remember that as a short-faced breed Pugs aren't tolerant of hot weather, and they shouldn't do strenuous exercise when it's warm or humid out'¿better to be in air-conditioning. Some canine sports in which Pugs participate and excel include agility, obedience, and rally.","The Pug has been bred to be a companion and a pleasure to his owners. He has an even and stable temperament, great charm, and an outgoing, loving disposition. Pugs live to please their people, so they are generally easy to train. Their feelings are easily hurt, and harsh training methods should never be used. A Pug wants to be with his family and will be unhappy if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended."

Bred to work closely with humans, these agile and faithful little dynamos are quick learners.
First, there are those dreadlocks, the instantly recognizable feature of the Puli (pronounced ""Poo-lee"", ""Pulik"" is the plural). The coat's naturally occurring cords are wooly, dense, and weatherproof. Either corded or brushed out, Puli coats require lots of attention. Under the dreads there's a compact but powerful dog, standing 16 to 17 inches at the shoulder. Pulik are remarkably agile and light on their feet, earning a reputation as the 'acrobat of the dog world.'","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Reputable breeders test their breeding stock for health problems that can occur in most any breed. Breeders who are members of the Puli Club of America agree to the club's guidelines, which include Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) testing to determine that breeding stock is free of inheritable disease. The CHIC testing required by the breed's parent club includes OFA or PennHIP screening for hip dysplasia, OFA test for patella, OFA test for degenerative myelopathy (DNA test), and CERF eye testing (to be updated every three years). Additional tests that can be performed, but are not required, include OFA for elbows, cardiac, and thyroid, and the BAER (hearing) test. If you are considering getting a Puli, ask the breeder if they test for these conditions, in particular the club's required tests.","The Puli can be kept corded, brushed, or with a clipped coat. Until a Puli puppy is 8 to 10 months old, there is no grooming to do except for regular bathing  and ears, and grinding toe nails. When the Puli's undercoat begins to come in, the coat will begin to feel thick and matted to your fingers. You will begin to feel natural separations in the coat, where the hair seems to clump together close to the skin. This is the beginning of a cord. At this time, you can separate these soft clumps from each other by pulling them apart with your fingers. Cords are simply 'organized mats' that have tightened up with time. This is a process that will be repeated many times over the course of about six to nine months. Once the coat has distinct cords, all you do is bathe the dog when needed and separate the cords'¿a good time to do this is while you are watching TV and need something to do with your hands. The breed's national parent club, the  Puli Club of America, provides a number of articles on grooming on the club's website.","The Puli is a high-drive dog who requires both physical and mental stimulation. In fact, mental exercise is as important as physical exercise for this breed. Reputable breeders caution people to not overdo the physical exercise when the dog is young and the growth plates have not yet fused or closed. The Puli excels at canine sports including herding, obedience, and agility, among other activities.","This is a breed that needs to be kept mentally active. Pulik are incredibly intelligent, agile, and loyal, which makes them able to learn quickly, and they strive to please their owners. However, they do not suffer fools lightly (there is a running joke that you need to be very smart to own a Puli), and they require a firm but fair hand. This is a headstrong breed who has no problem humiliating you in public'¿so prepare yourself. Pulik are herding dogs, and as such, many of them do not give up control easily. They will follow commands, but they do things their own way. They do not care for repetition. With puppies especially, it is important to do proper socialization."

The breed is famed for its intelligence, agility, and boldness.
The Pumi (POO-mee; plural Pumik) was conceived as a compact, quick, and fearless sheepherder capable of moving flocks on the narrow roads connecting the pastures of western Hungary. At a glance, it might be hard to believe that this cuddly charmer was born to do such tough work. With his coat of corkscrew curls, circular tail, expressive ears, and distinctively whimsical look, the Pumi is all kinds of cute. But beneath the curls is a lean, deep-chested herder with a seemingly endless capacity for work and play.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Pumis are generally a very healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen for health disorders such as elbow and hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, degenerative myelopathy (DM), and eye disorders. The website of the breed's parent club, the Hungarian Pumi Club of America, provides detailed information on Pumi health.","The Pumi's coat consists of 50 percent soft hair and 50 percent harsher hair, all the same length. He needs combing every three to six weeks, followed by a good wetting-down to let the coat curl back up. Once curled, the coat can be trimmed to keep it looking tidy. The Pumi doesn't shed, but hair will come out during grooming. Using a blow-dryer on the Pumi's coat is not recommended, as this will remove the characteristic curls.","The Pumi is very intelligent and energetic, needing regular exercise and mental stimulation. They're also quite agile and will climb over and under things, and they love to be in high places to see what's going on. Their favorite toys are often tennis balls and flying discs, and a Pumi is likely to demand a good chase-and-fetch game with these. The breed's qualities make the Pumi increasingly popular in agility, obedience, and numerous other dog sports and companion events.","The Pumi is a thinking dog who must assess each new situation, so it is vital for the breed to have early socialization as puppies. A Pumi will learn quickly and has a boundless willingness to work without being obsessive about it. He is an active dog, and if provided with daily exercise and mental activity he makes a wonderful housedog. Because Pumik enjoy using their voices, barking should not be reinforced."

Today, while it is still an effective guardian, many families have found the joy of owning the gentle and loving, yet independent, Pyrenean Mastiff.
The Pyrenean Mastiff is friendly towards humans, calm, noble and very intelligent. At the same time, he is courageous and proud towards strangers, from whom he never backs away. In his behavior towards other dogs, he is good-natured and aware of his superior strength. Though he will do his job to alert when strangers or animals come around, he is not known for being an incessant barker. As a guardian breed, the Pyrenean Mastiff has a very low prey drive and, therefore, loves and protects all creatures, human and animal alike. They love children and welcome friends and family, and only feel the need to protect when its a real threat. All that love can get a bit messy though; just like any mastiff, they do drool and quite profusely when exposed to heat, food, or water.

","As a rare dog breed, there is not enough information to identify any specific genetic illnesses known to be prevalent. But as with all giant, deep-chested breeds, they can experience gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) and hip dysplasia.","Bathe your Pyrenean Mastiff as required, though less is better in order to retain the natural oils in his coat. Brushing at least every three days will keep the coat mat-free and fresh. Trim nails to include dewclaws, and trim mats that may appear between the toes. The Pyrenean Mastiff is a double-coated breed, so it does shed twice a year. Beyond those times, it does not typically shed much hair. Use a rake to aid in removing loose hairs when shedding.","Allowing free play all the time except right after eating is fine, but walking your Pyrenean Mastiff puppy can be harmful if the distance is not increased slowly. Extra-large-breed puppies grow rapidly, and their bones are soft and take a long time to harden and mature. You also want to be sure that you try to walk them on soil or unpaved paths, if at all possible. Concrete is hard on their joints. Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day.

Tough and sinewy Pyr Sheps come in 'rough-faced' and 'smooth-faced' coat varieties.
These tough, lean, and lively herders, famous for their vigorous and free-flowing movement, come in two coat varieties: rough-faced and smooth-faced. Roughs have profuse, 'windswept' hair above the muzzle and a generally harsh coat; smooths have short facial hair, a finer-textured coat, and a slightly longer, pointier muzzle. Both varieties of this sinewy, rectangular breed come in many colors and patterns. Pyr Sheps see the world through dark almond-shaped eyes conveying an alert and cunning expression.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","The Pyrenean Shepherd is a healthy breed with a long expected lifespan. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, patellar subluxation, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), epilepsy, and eye defects such as choroidal hypoplasia (CH) and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). Dedicated breeders do genetic testing on all potential breeding stock with the aim of reducing and hopefully ultimately eliminating certain conditions from the breed's gene pool.","The Pyr Shep needs weekly brushing to keep his coat free from mats and tangles and looking its best. His scruffy appearance comes from his double coat'¿a soft undercoat and a protective outer coat'¿which features a combination of straight and short to moderately long hair. The harsh outer coat may shed quite a bit, while the soft undercoat can mat very easily. The coat can be kept combed out and left as it grows, or can be corded as desired. Cleaning ears and trimming nails are an important part of his grooming routine.","The Pyr Shep is a high-energy dog who is always on alert and ready for action. Since many Pyr Sheps today don't get the chance to do what they were originally bred for'¿herding livestock'¿they are always eager to channel their abundant energy into other interesting challenges and activities. Lots of activity and a job to do are vital to the breed's mental, emotional, and physical health.","The Pyr Shep is very smart, energetic, and trainable. They strive to please and are extremely connected with their owners. They love games and opportunities for intense activity. Pyr Sheps were bred to herd using their bodies, instead of with eye contact as some other breeds do. With an intuitive sense about their owner's desires, they will respond enthusiastically to clicker training and other positive, reward-based methods. The breed is a great candidate for agility, rally, obedience, dock diving, freestyle work, and almost any fun dog sport."

Working with a responsible breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed.","Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep your Rafeiro do Alentejo clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. The ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Options for exercise could include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities such as hiking or retrieving balls can provide a good outlet for expending energy. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience, and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.",

Balanced, compactly built Rat Terriers are tough but elegant-looking. There are two size divisions: Miniatures stand 10 to 13 inches at the shoulder; standards are over 13 inches and as high as 18 inches. The smooth, shiny coat comes in varieties of pied patterns. (Pied, a word borrowed from the horseman's lexicon, means 'comparatively large patches of one or more colors in combination with white.') These smoothly muscled exterminators are constructed for the efficient movement required for a long day's work.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","Rat Terriers are generally very healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, patellar luxation (loose kneecaps), Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, and cardiac and eye disorders. A conscientious breeder does genetic testing of all breeding stock with the aim of reducing the incidence of and ultimately eliminating health problems.","The Rat Terrier's short, dense coat requires very little care to remain in good condition. A weekly once-over with a soft brush or hound glove will keep his coat healthy and glossy. A bath every month or so will likely be enough, depending on the dog's lifestyle. Rat Terriers shed seasonally, during which time a shedding tool or rubber curry brush will help remove loose hair. The nails should be trimmed at least monthly, keeping them short and neat, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog. Check his ears weekly, and remove any excess wax and debris, which can cause ear infections. Teeth should be brushed daily if possible, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","Some Rat Terriers can get sufficient exercise for their needs through indoor playtime, but most will thrive with daily walks and a bit of tennis-ball-chasing and other play in a fenced enclosure. They tend to do well with other dogs their size or larger. Early socialization is a must, and puppy training classes are recommended. The Rat Terrier has a strong prey drive, and they should never be allowed off lead, as most will not be able to resist the urge to chase when faced with a strange cat or squirrel.","The Rat Terrier is extremely intelligent and trainable, although some can be stubborn and determined at times.

Though the breed was made famous in its native Africa for its skill at tracking and baying, but never, ever killing,  lions, today Ridgebacks are cherished family dogs whose owners must be prepared to deal with their independence and strong prey drive.
Beneath the Ridgeback's trademark ridge is a whole lot of hound: Ridgebacks are fast and powerful athletes who can weigh between 70 and 85 pounds, and oftentimes more. They come in only one color, wheaten, which spans every shade seen in a wheat field, from pale flaxen to the burnished red of a maturing crop. Ridgebacks also have two nose colors: black and the less commonly seen brown. The formidable Ridgeback can be strong-willed, independent, and sometimes domineering. Ridgebacks must be guided with a firm but a fair hand from puppyhood. They are faithful friends, protective of their loved ones, and meltingly affectionate with those whom they trust.

Most Carpathian Shepherds today are still working in the Romanian mountains, performing the same jobs they were selected for hundreds of years ago, and, when they are not doing that, they are loyal companions and vigilant guardians of homes and families. Frequently described as ¿noble¿ dogs due to their proud and dignified elegance, the Carpathians are big and strong, standing as high as 30 inches at the shoulder and often weighing more than 100 pounds. These fierce guardians usually are very calm and balanced, appearing indifferent at times, while preserving their energy for the real danger. At the right moment, they will quickly spring into action and move with unexpected agility, speed and determination to meet a threat.

For this reason, the purebred Romanian Carpathian Shepherds have no known genetical issues.  They naturally eat much less than expected for their size and they will usually stop eating when they are full. However, insisting on overfeeding them can become a problem if not controlled.","The Romanian Carpathians Shepherds¿ furry double-coat is dense to protect them equally from cold and heat and it varies from short on the front of the limbs and head to long on the tail, back of limbs, chest, and around the neck. They shed a lot of the undercoat when the warm seasons are starting, around May-June. Brushing is necessary occasionally, using a de-shedding brush, or a dog undercoat rake.

If they don¿t have a herd to guard, they need at least 1-2 hours a day moderate activity: walks, nose work, puzzles, and play time. They are mostly pack motivated much more than food and toy motivated. It¿s necessary to have a fenced yard, or be kept on a leash, as they do like to roam on their territory.","The Romanian Carpathian Shepherds were bred to have a mind of their own, and to work with little human guidance, watching and protecting their flock first and foremost.

The breed is very impressive in size and character.
Used for centuries to guard livestock in its homeland of Romania, the Mioritic Sheepdog is a typical Livestock Guarding Dog (LGD). Loyal, reliable, independent, and fiercely protective, he is friendly and devoted to his family but very mistrusting of strangers. It is a large dog with long coat which requires regular grooming, and with any dog of this size and temperament requires daily exercise and basic obedience training. Mioritics are lively and stubborn but in spite of all their independence they are very sensitive creatures in their furry armor. As puppies they stick to the pack which has accepted them. This can be any kind of creature ' dog, cat, horse, sheep, the Mioritic needs very close family ties; a house without doors it thinks would be ideal. This certainly depends a great deal on the weather. Its favorite place is always very close to its favorite person. It determines its resting place itself. This may even be the couch or a carpet not suitable for dogs, but as a rule shepherds, even as puppies, prefer to sleep on hard ground. They need no dog baskets, no special mattresses and by no means an allocated place. No 'work creating' program is necessary but daily walks and hikes provide exciting variation.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Because the Mioritic is recently rescued from the countryside in Romania there is little medical information available. We do know that bloat is always a danger, as it is with any large breed dog. Also hip dysplasia has been seen. Those dogs who do live a normal healthy life have been known to live up to 14 years.","Despite the breed´s scraggly fur, our dogs are very low-maintenance. They do not require a bath, nor daily brushing. In the event that they become wet or totally filthy, the dogs are simply confined for a time, until the dirt, mud, or what-not may be easily brushed out. A dry Mioritic is a clean Mioritic.



 Besides the daily monitoring of eyes, ears, and teeth, the dogs also undergo a thorough grooming once a week. The pups are accustomed to the grooming procedures early on as part daily training, since grooming serves establish hierarchy: The dog allowing the grooming, accepts the dominance of the one doing grooming.",Growing puppies will have plenty of energy and will need daily walks and attention. Adults will be much more taciturn and a daily walk would be enough for them. Livestock Guarding Dog's in general are not high energy because their preference is to stay with the flock (or people).,"Romanian Mioritic Shepherd Dog's are extremely territory conscious and they are incorruptible guardians. But their territory does not end at the property gate! It can be anywhere where the pack is or stays. Everything is guarded that can be seen from a watch post usually chosen at an elevated place.



 They are absolute creatures of habit which react immediately to anything unusual '¦.first with attention, then by loud barking and, if necessary, with attack or defense.



 The 'little sheep' are serious guardians who love their territory, their pack and their routines'¦and all this they do not want to see being disturbed."

The glistening, short black coat with smart rust markings add to the picture of imposing strength. A thickly muscled hindquarters powers the Rottie's effortless trotting gait.



 A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm and confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive. The aloof demeanor these world-class guardians present to outsiders belies the playfulness, and downright silliness, that endear Rotties to their loved ones. (No one told the Rottie he's not a toy breed, so he is liable plop onto your lap for a cuddle.) Early training and socialization will harness a Rottie's territorial instincts in a positive way.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Before breeding, responsible Rottweiler breeders have potential sires and dams tested for health problems such as hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joint that can be detected via X-ray; eye diseases and heart conditions. Cancer sometimes occurs in the breed, as in all dogs. David Waters, Ph.D., DVM, of the Gerald P. Murphy Cancer Foundation, has done research focused on cancer prevention funded by the Rottweiler Health Foundation. Dr. Waters has discovered that cancer and longevity are linked to a careful vaccination regimen, thus strengthening the immune system, as well as keeping males and females intact until at least six years of age.","The Rottweiler has a straight, coarse, medium-length outer coat that lies flat. The undercoat is present on the neck and thighs. He should be brushed weekly and bathed regularly. He sheds only very moderately for most of the year, although he will shed more profusely twice a year, usually in the spring and fall. His teeth should be brushed and nails trimmed weekly. The use of a grinding tool such as a Dremel is especially effective in trimming the nails.","Rottweilers love swimming, walking, and trotting, especially with their people. The breed is muscular and athletic, and should have the opportunity to exercise on a daily basis. If there are jobs to do, Rottweilers learn easily to cart and are excellent workers in herding, tracking, and obedience. There is no limit to the canine activities that the Rottweiler can learn to do. Excess weight is not good for any dog, and exercise can help to keep your Rottweiler fit and healthy.","The Rottweiler must be trained starting early in his life. Leadership, puppy socialization, basic training classes, and living in the owner's home are key to raising a well-mannered Rottweiler. Rottweilers are 'people dogs' who do not do well isolated from humans and life experiences. No matter the breed, dogs must live in this world complete with strange animals and people. One expert in the breed notes, 'As a Rottweiler owner, it is my responsibility to spend time, energy, and money giving my dog the opportunities to learn on a day-to-day basis.' The breed is intelligent, highly trainable and wants to please, although some may be stubborn. It is very important that discipline be consistent, fair, and firm, without being rough. Roughhousing with the Rottweiler may encourage aggression and should be avoided. Rottweilers excel in many canine sports, and the breed works with a human partner in many functional roles."

The Russell's nails should be trimmed monthly, and his ears checked weekly for debris or excess wax and cleaned as needed.","The Russell Terrier is not a breed for a couch-potato family. High energy levels and a robust personality make this an excellent choice of breed for an outdoorsy family who takes lots of hikes, bike rides, and long daily walks. Finding games he loves to play will help keep his brain and his body exercised. A tired Russell Terrier is a good RT. With an almost limitless supply of energy, this makes a great companion dog for children who understand dogs. The breed has retained a strong prey drive so should be very well socialized early on to circumvent any problems that might result from that trait.","The first tool one must have when training a Russell Terrier is a good sense of humor. They are extremely intelligent and love to work on problems and play games. They bore easily, so training sessions must be kept entertaining if you want them to learn. They master tricks easily and love entertaining people by performing. They throw themselves into any job or activity with the same dedication they were bred to have for hunting purposes.

The Russian Toy is a toy breed with a lineage that dates back to the Russian aristocracy. In general, he is a good-natured imp that loves to run and play. They will dash through the house or yard chasing toys as long as you can keep up, while many others are willing to do nothing more than lounge in your lap all day long, content in knowing that they are the prize jewel in your home. They thrive on human companionship and will let you know if they are feeling neglected. Their coat is either semi-long or smooth. The longhaired variety carries a nice ruff on the chest and unique feathering on the extremities, tail and ears. Long-coated Russian Toys will not have an adult coat until it is more than a year old and full fringing not until three years of age. The smooth-coated variety is sleek and smooth to the touch. There is also a slight attitude difference between the two varieties. Smooth Coats tend to be a little more terrier-like than Long Coats. However, both share a larger-than-life personality.

","The Russian Toy is an overall healthy breed; like many toy breeds, their primary health concern is their teeth. Most puppies do not lose all of their deciduous (puppy) teeth and require surgical removal of the remaining deciduous teeth by nine months of age. Periodontal disease, the build-up of tooth tartar, can begin by one year of age. Regular dental care such as teeth brushing can reduce plaque and prevent surgical dental cleaning or teeth removal. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and patellar luxation, and owners should be aware of the risk for eye injuries, such as ulcers.","The longhaired variety requires more grooming than the smooth-coated variety for obvious reasons. The long coat has body hair from 1-3 inches long. Their ears are covered with thick, long hair forming a fringe, and there are distinct feathers on the rear side of his limbs. The longhaired variety should be brushed two to three times per week and fringes should be kept free of debris. Monthly baths with high-quality shampoo and conditioner are usually enough to keep the coat healthy.



 The smooth-coated Russian Toy has short, close-lying, shiny hair without an undercoat or fringes. Regular weekly brushing with a soft brush along with occasional baths is recommended to keep the smooth coat free of dead hair and flaky skin. A daily shammy wipe-down adds luster to the coat, too.","The Russian Toy is considered to have a moderately high energy. They need regular exercise, but because of their small size, a regular yard or long run is usually sufficient. They love going for walks with their humans and love to run and play until they collapse in your lap for a long snuggle.



 Because small dogs have more fragile necks and tracheas than large dogs, it is recommended that a leash be attached to a harness instead of a collar when walking your Russian Toy. It is also recommended that you do not leave a collar or harness on your Russian while in your home. Many times a collar or harness can get caught on things around the house and injure your little imp.","Generally, Russian Toys are agreeable and eager to please, making them very trainable. However, they are still terriers at heart, can be stubborn, and will try to be the boss. Their clown-like antics and outgoing friendly personality make them great candidates for agility and trick-dog competition.



 The RTCA, the breed's AKC parent club, highly recommends early socialization of your puppy. Many all-breed kennel clubs, community centers, and veterinarians offer puppy kindergarten classes as well as many levels of obedience training."

Bolonki were originally bred to be the ultimate house pet for apartment living. Sweet, loving, intelligent, and willing to please, he is friendly to all and shows no sign of aggression.
The Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka, or Bolonka for short, is a member of the Bichon family that was almost extinct until after the Cold War. It is a small companion dog that is hypoallergenic, funny, clever beyond words and intensely loyal to its family. Some are excellent mimics; others are content to sit by the door and monitor who is allowed in or out. Spirited, yet easy-going and sociable, the Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka is great with children. Although they are quick to alert, they will not be a constant barker with early training on appropriate behavior. They are fairly independent for a toy breed and require early socialization with people. However, Bolonki do get along well with dogs and other animals. Very clever and smart, they do well in formal training such as obedience, rally, tracking and agility when trained with a firm, but gentle, hand.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","Routine health checks should include eye, patella, and heart examinations. To avoid patella injuries, young dogs should not be encouraged to jump until they are adults. Keeping topknots tied up will help to prevent corneal abrasions to the eyes. Although not found frequently in Bolonki, responsible breeders also screen their stock for health conditions such as liver shunt, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and PRA.","The Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka requires regular brushing and routine care for eyes, ears, teeth, and nails. Brush or comb the coat with a wide-tooth comb on a regular basis several times per week to prevent mats from forming. Dogs kept in full coat may need their face, mustache, and beard washed daily. For show purposes, no other trimming other than the feet is permitted, and the coat on the back should fall naturally and should not be deliberately parted. The eyes and ears should be checked frequently for foreign matter, injury, and irritation. Keeping the eyes clean will help avoid infections. Hair in the eyes can cause irritation, leading up to painful corneal scratches and ulcers. Drop ears are prone to infection, particularly after bathing or swimming, so be sure to keep ears clean and dry.","As classic lapdogs, Bolonki enjoy walks and playtime, but do not require a great deal exercise. They can be very energetic and play driven, however, and should have a good romp at least twice per week. In addition to walks, exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks.","More independent than is usual for a toy breed, Bolonki require early socialization with people. However, they are very friendly with children and other animals, though supervision is always a good idea. In addition, Bolonki may like to alert you to everything that is happening around them, so training them to understand when vocalizations are appropriate may be necessary. This breed is very clever and smart and does well in obedience, rally, tracking, and agility when trained with a firm, but gentle, hand."

Saints are famously watchful and patient 'nanny dogs' for children.
Not ranked particularly high in AKC registrations, this genial giant is nonetheless among the world's most famous and beloved breeds. The Saint's written standard abounds with phrases like 'very powerful,' 'extraordinarily muscular,' 'imposing,' and 'massive.' A male stands a minimum 27.5 inches at the shoulder; females will be smaller and more delicately built. The huge head features a wrinkled brow, a short muzzle, and dark eyes, combining to give Saints the intelligent, friendly expression that was such a welcome sight to stranded Alpine travelers.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Large and deep-chested breeds can develop bloat, a sudden, life-threatening stomach condition. Saint Bernard owners should learn what signs to look out for, and what actions to take should they occur. Other conditions sometimes seen in the breed include hip dysplasia and eye disease. A Saint can handle hot weather as long as he has a cool place to rest and lots of water, but going from air conditioning to high heat can cause serious distress.","Saint Bernards come in long-haired and short-haired varieties, but both types of coats require the same care. Weekly brushing will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Any tangles can be worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. During shedding season, which occurs twice a year, brushing will become a daily activity. The occasional bath will keep the Saint looking and smelling fresh. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","Despite being a large and powerful breed, the St. Bernard only requires a moderate amount of exercise. One long walk or half-hour play session per day should be enough to keep him healthy and happy. Of course, if his owner wants to take longer hikes, or go backpacking or on a camping trip, a Saint is always happy to go along. Saints often enjoy pulling young children in a cart, and some even participate in carting and drafting competitions. A Saint is happiest when he is doing activities together with his owner.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all dogs, but are absolutely required for dogs as big and strong as a St. Bernard. Obedience training will help the Saint learn not to jump on people, knock into small children, steal food from the table, and otherwise take advantage of their size. Saints are kind-hearted and eager to please, so they generally start responding to commands as soon they understand what is expected of them. A Saint wants to be with his family, and undesirable behaviors can result if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time."

Salukis are swift and agile sprinters who love a good chase. They make gentle, dignified, and independent but loyal pets.
The beauty of Salukis has been a thing of wonder for thousands of years. They're slim and leggy, but very strong and perfectly balanced, like a great athlete or dancer. Males can stand between 23 and 28 inches at the shoulder; females can be much shorter. They come in a many colors and patterns. Their large, oval-shaped eyes are warm and intelligent.



 Salukis are highly adaptable, able to live and work in any climate.

","As a breed, Salukis are free from serious genetic diseases. Some may develop heart conditions such as valve disease or arrhythmia, and enlarged hearts are not unknown. Certain cancers such as hemangiosarcoma or osteosarcoma, lymphoma, or mammary cancers (the latter is prevented by early spaying) can occur, and some autoimmune and blood conditions have been reported. Vigorous running and playing after eating can cause bloat, or gastric torsion (which is a life-threatening emergency and needs immediate intervention). Generally, however, Salukis enjoy a healthy, active life from birth to old age.","Salukis have two types of coats'¿feathered and smooth'¿and both are easily groomed with weekly brushing, although if they have long ear or tail feathering, that may take a bit more attention. Many Saluki owners use a snood to keep ear feathering out of the food bowl (smooth Salukis do not have that problem). Salukis are very clean dogs and known for not having a 'doggy' odor. Bathing need only be done if they get dirty or before a dog show.","Salukis need regular exercise to keep fit, and daily walks (always on a leash) will help both hound and owner stay in shape, physically and mentally. Salukis love to run and should have a well-fenced yard to keep them safely away from traffic. Like other dogs, Salukis can be escape artists or destructive chewers when bored or unhappy at home, so good fencing and safe toys and chew-bones are a must.","The Saluki will benefit from three types of training: (1) Crate training is recommended for those times when the dog needs to be safely confined in the home or while traveling. (2) Basic obedience training will help the dog learn manners in the home and community. Well-behaved dogs are welcome almost everywhere. (3) For mental stimulation and exercise, canine sports such as lure coursing, flyball, and agility are all fun options. Lastly, if you start when they are young, it is possible to train Salukis to hold still for nail trimming and daily teeth brushing."

The Schapendoes were everywhere in the Netherlands during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but their numbers dwindled drastically when Border Collies were imported. When the breed club for Nederlandse Schapendoes was founded in 1947, the Schapendoes breed was resuscitated. The Schapendoes is a lightly-built, long-coated, medium-sized dog. His movements are effortless and springy and his astounding ability to jump makes him excel at agility and other dog sports.

","Some dogs may be faced with these issues in their lives, but the majority of Schapendoes are healthy dogs. Working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Schapendoes can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize genetic testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep the Schapendoes clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The strong fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Schapendoes needs a lot of exercise. Daily running for an hour keeps him fit and prevents nervousness. Other options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather.

Curious, lively, and intense but mischievous, this little black dog is a robust, long-lived companion for whom there is never a dull moment.
Standing no higher than 13 inches, Schipperkes are small dogs built for hard work. Schips were created as ratters and watchdogs. Their powerful jaws, necks, and forequarters'¿coupled with a stealthy, catlike hunting style'¿make them ideal rat-catching machines. The black coat is profuse around the neck, shoulders, and legs, giving the breed a silhouette that accentuates a thick, substantial body. The foxy face completes the unique look of a unique breed. If you can't tell a Schipperke from an ordinary dog, you simply haven't been paying attention.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Schipperkes are generally healthy dogs, and reputable breeders screen their breeding stock for health concerns such as luxating patellas (slipping kneecaps), Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (hip problems), eye problems, and thyroid problems. Breeders can also test for MPS IIIB, a newly recognized and fatal disease that usually shows up by 2-4 years of age as balance problems, and avoid producing the disease by identifying carriers and breeding them appropriately. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog has a long, healthy life.","The Schipperke's coat needs only weekly brushing, though they do go through a shedding season once or twice a year. During these periods, more frequent brushing will help to keep the amount of shed hair under control. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.","Schipperkes are very active, energetic, and busy little dogs. A brisk daily walk or a romp in a fenced yard will provide needed exercise. They love playing and exploring, and they thrive in households that have the time and patience to properly train them and appreciate their playful personalities. Schips can also let off steam racing around the house or apartment.","Due to their watchdog tendencies, Schipperkes can turn into barkers if not taught otherwise. Equally happy in an apartment or a home with a large yard, they should be kept on leash when not in a fenced area and should be taken to obedience classes. Schips absolutely need to be trained to come when called as early as possible, due to their instinctive urge to go exploring. They have an independent nature and can be a challenge to train.

","Although a giant breed, a significant percentage of Scottish Deerhounds live to old age. While the breed does have some genetic health issues, the good news is many of the problems can be avoided, prevented, or treated successfully if the owner is proactive. Puppy buyers should buy a puppy from a responsible breeder who does the breed¿s recommended health tests and will be a resource for the dog¿s entire life. Another key to Deerhound health (in addition to good genes) is for the dog to be happy and well exercised. Deerhounds need a lot of exercise daily throughout their lives. For dogs under 18 months, the exercise needs to be age-appropriate; owners should consult with their dog¿s breeder and veterinarian for exercise recommendations for youngsters.  Also, they are devoted family dogs that are happiest when their owners include them into their lives as much as possible. Finally, owners can educate themselves about the breed's problems such as osteosarcoma, dilated cardiomyopathy, cystinuria, surgery-related issues (Factor VII deficiency, slow drug metabolism, delayed bleeding, and hyperthermia), liver shunt, and GDV/gastric or splenic torsion/bloat so problems can be avoided or identified and treated as early as possible, which greatly improves outcomes, in many cases. Detailed information on the breed¿s health and research can be found on the Scottish Deerhound Club of America¿s Deerhound Health website at https://deerhoundhealth.org/.","The Scottish Deerhound's harsh, somewhat wiry coat is very easy to care for, requiring only an all-over brushing and combing every week or so. He will also need a trim of his nails every few weeks if they aren't worn down naturally. Grooming tools to have on hand include a slicker brush, a fine-toothed metal dog comb, and an electric nail grinder or a pair of heavy-duty dog nail clippers. A occasional bath will help to reduce any doggy odor. Grooming sessions are a good time to inspect the dog all over for any new lumps or skin problems, and to check that the eyes and ears are healthy and trouble free.","Deerhound puppies are difficult to raise to their potential without a companion playmate and a large, securely fenced play area. This breed cannot be left crated in the house while the owner is at work all day if it is to develop properly to adulthood, both physically and mentally. Both puppies and adults need to be able to exercise freely on a daily basis and do what Deerhounds were bred to do'¿run for the sheer joy of running. Destructive puppies are generally not getting enough exercise. Forced exercise, such as running with a bike, should be avoided with immature hounds. Older Deerhounds are hard to pry off your couch, but they do require regular daily exercise regardless. While nutrition and exercise are key to raising a puppy into a fit, well-muscled adult, the secret to a healthy, long-lived Deerhound (in addition to good genes) is being happy and well exercised. This is not a breed that handles stress well, nor is it a breed that will thrive with just a daily leash-walk around the city block. Fitness should be maintained throughout old age.","The most beautiful Deerhound puppy in the world will turn into a wonderful adult only if given lots of gentle human companionship, exercise, and proper nutrition. Deerhounds are sensitive and respond best to positive training methods. They won't do well in a kennel or left in a crate while their people go to work. While he possesses a quiet and dignified personality in the home, the Scottish Deerhound may try to chase any furry animals that run past him. For that reason, the breed should be exercised on leash or in a fenced area. Although he enjoys his family, his size may be intimidating to smaller children."

 The Scottie working style has been described as efficient and businesslike, and their aloofness toward strangers makes them excellent watchdogs. Their hunting instinct remains strong, which can complicate life for the neighbor's cat, and Scotties are known to be cantankerous around other dogs.

","The breed's national parent club, the Scottish Terrier Club of America, provides excellent information regarding breed health issues on the club website. A good breeder will discuss with you what they have encountered in their lines. There is also some excellent research being done, much of which is supported by the club, to help breeders identify health conditions and make better decisions when choosing to breed. That means overall better health for the future generations.","Scottish Terriers require regularly scheduled grooming. They are a dual-coated breed, with a harsh, wiry outer layer and dense, soft undercoat. Ideally, they are hand stripped. This should be started when they are young puppies so they get used to the process. Once a month would be best once the coat is started, but they can be worked on weekly. If you are not doing it yourself, it may be hard to find a groomer who will do this for a pet. In that case it is acceptable to clipper the coat. With clipping you will eventually lose the correct harsh texture, as the undercoat will take over once the cutting process is begun. Clipped coats can be maintained on a six- to eight-week schedule. A weekly brushing and comb-out will keep the Scottie's coat tangle free and the skin healthy. Periodic baths with the grooming is acceptable with a good-quality moisturizing shampoo.","Scottish Terriers need a good walk, but also good playtime. They have high energy and need to expend some of that in bursts. Throwing a ball or toy around that they can chase works great. Their nickname is the 'diehard,' and all you have to do is play tug with a favorite toy to see they won't stop or let go until you do. All of that activity will keep them in good shape and attitude. This makes them great dogs for a small home or apartment living.","Scottish Terriers do best with training sessions not lasting more than 15 minutes at a time. Be creative, and do not repeat the training the same way all the time. This breed is a thinker, and if they get bored, they will not respond. Remember, the farmers kept the dogs who could figure things out'¿not the ones who had to be told what to do. Don't be surprised when they test you. There is an independent streak in them. That is best focused when you make it seem like it is their idea to do something. They respond greatly to vocal tones and know why you are displeased by your voice. Just be persistent, and reward good behavior."

 A typical Sealy is well-muscled, built low to ground, and moves easily with long, determined strides. The weatherproof coat is predominantly white, and a long, broad head is furnished with lavish facial hair. Despite their rep as the bruiser among short-legged terriers, Sealys are cute, funny, affectionate, outgoing, and trainable, if a bit stubborn. Their alertness and a big-dog bark make Sealys excellent watchdogs.

They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Allergies are fairly common in the breed but are seldom of a really serious nature. There are several genetic eye diseases that potential sires and dams should be tested for before breeding. The American Sealyham Terrier Club provides detailed information on breed health. Non-genetic eye conditions such as tearing and infections can occur because of the breed's long eyebrows. If the dog is a pet, a shorter eyebrow fall is a good idea. Ear infections can occur due to the weight and position of the ears, but keeping the ears clean is usually all that is required for prevention and maintenance.","The breed's weather-resistant, double 'jacket' and profuse leg and body furnishings must be combed and brushed every two or three days, as Sealy coats tend to mat easily. The coat does not shed but must be hand-stripped or clipped on a regular basis. Pet Sealyhams can be kept trimmed short with minimal furnishings, which makes their care easier. Bathing every three to four weeks is a good idea. For Sealyhams in show coat, washing at least the furnishings frequently is a must. The nails should be trimmed regularly, and the eyes and ears  should be checked during grooming sessions.","Sealys love to run in a safely enclosed area and enjoy plenty of exercise. They can overheat in hot, humid weather, so exercise is best in the early morning and in the evening. Grass stains are common, and it may be necessary to wash furnishings and condition often. Encourage Sealys to exercise so they get moderately tired, but not exhausted, and they will be calmer in the house. Sealys can be very active, and exercise helps them be better house pets.","As with most terriers, Sealys require a firm but not harsh training technique. The Sealy puppy should be socialized early, being gently exposed to a wide range of dogs, people, and places, and this will help to discourage any dog aggression later on. Sealys can be food guarders, and this must be corrected right away. Don't allow the dog to get away with it, ever."

The coat, along with a long, wedge-shaped head; small, three-quarter erect ears; and deep-chested, level-backed torso, give Shelties the look of a rough-coated Collie in miniature.



 Bright and eager Shelties are easy trainers and world-class competitors in obedience, agility, and herding trials. They are sensitive and affectionate family dogs, highly in tune with the mood of the household. They like to bark and tend to be reserved toward strangers'¿two qualifications of an excellent watchdog.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Shetland Sheepdogs are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, thyroid disease, eye diseases, dermatomyositis (Sheltie skin syndrome), von Willebrand's disease (vWD), gallbladder mucoceles, and epilepsy. Tests are available for many potentially heritable disorders, and minimum health testing of breeding stock is recommended by the breed's national parent club, the American Shetland Sheepdog Association (ASSA).","The Sheltie has a profuse double coat that sheds considerably. The outer coat consists of long, straight, harsh hair, while the undercoat is short, furry, and very dense. Owners must be prepared to brush the coat weekly, and more often during shedding season, to help in removing at least some of the loose hair before it drifts all over the house. Be sure to check for mats behind the ears, under the elbow on each front leg, and in the ""pants"" under the tail. Shaving the dog is not recommended, because the coat protects against sunburn and heat as well as cold. The Sheltie needs a bath only occasionally. The nails should be trimmed regularly.","Shelties are active and athletic, and while they need a moderate amount of exercise they are also very adaptable to their family's way of life. They do well as city dogs as long as owners provide sufficient exercise. They enjoy outings with their people that will exercise both their mind and body. Shelties enjoy and excel in many canine events, including obedience, agility, herding, and tracking, and they shine as therapy dogs.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Very intelligent, trainable, and willing to please, the Sheltie will reach his full potential as a companion when taught at least basic obedience'¿and they are superstars at canine sports such as agility. Shelties can be quite vocal and express their happiness with barking, so owners must be prepared to teach the dog to stop barking when desired. As is common with other herding breeds, Shelties like to chase moving things, including cars, so they should have a well-fenced yard and be walked on a leash."

Today, the spirited, good-natured Shiba is the most popular companion dog in Japan. The adaptable Shiba is at home in town or country.
Brought to America from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity in the West and are already the most popular breed in their homeland. Their white markings combined with their coloring (red, red sesame, or black and tan) and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them almost foxlike. They're sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The most common health condition in Shibas and in most breeds, as well as humans, is allergies. In dogs, allergies manifest themselves as skin irritation and itching. There is no way of testing breeding stock, but dogs with active allergies should not be bred. Unless the source of the allergen can be identified, most dogs with allergies can lead normal lives with products that treat the symptoms'¿again, just like humans. Allergies usually don't manifest themselves until a dog is at least 6 months old. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, eye disorders, and patella luxation.","Shibas shed '¿ a lot. It has been said that they shed twice a year, but some owners quip that it lasts for six months at a time. Unless a Shiba is a ""long coat,"" the coat does not mat, so infrequent brushing doesn't hurt the dog, but brushing or combing during periods of heavy shedding will reduce the amount of hair around the house. Blowing the dog with a strong blow-dryer or a shop vacuum in reverse is a good way to remove loose hair, dirt, and dandruff and to check for fleas. Most dogs learn to like the blower, as it feels good and doesn't scrape the skin or pull the coat. Don't let it get too hot, though. Shibas often object to nail trimming. Start a puppy early, but if it becomes a major struggle, let a professional do it.","Most Shibas are fairly energetic and love to go for walks. They are not so hyper that they will climb the walls if they don't get daily exercise, but a Shiba owner should be dedicated to exercising the dog, especially if the dog doesn't have an adequate yard in which to exercise himself. In general, Shibas are not massively destructive if left alone once they reach maturity, but some can suffer separation anxiety and should be able to spend periods of time crated even when the owners are home and at night. Crating guarantees a home will remain intact.","The one thing every Shiba owner must know is that a Shiba can never, ever be considered reliable off lead unless in a confined area. No amount of obedience training will ever change that. Letting a Shiba off lead'¿or any dog, for that matter'¿is playing Russian roulette with its life. An open door, an unlocked gate, a moment of inattentiveness, and the Shiba may be gone forever. On the positive side, a Shiba is practically born housebroken. By 4 weeks of age the puppy is trying to get as far away from his sleeping area as possible to eliminate. By 5 weeks the puppy will hold it all night and wait until taken outside to go. Controlling the bladder takes a little longer and depends a lot on immediate access to outdoors and diligence of the owner."

Those big dark eyes looking up at you with that sweet expression! It's no surprise that Shih Tzu owners have been so delighted with this little 'Lion Dog' for a thousand years. Where Shih Tzu go, giggles and mischief follow.
Shi Tsu (pronounced in the West 'sheed-zoo' or 'sheet-su'; the Chinese say 'sher-zer'), weighing between 9 to 16 pounds, and standing between 8 and 11 inches, are surprisingly solid for dogs their size. The coat, which comes in many colors, is worth the time you will put into it'¿few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu.



 Being cute is a way of life for this lively charmer. The Shih Tzu is known to be especially affectionate with children. As a small dog bred to spend most of their day inside royal palaces, they make a great pet if you live in an apartment or lack a big backyard. Some dogs live to dig holes and chase cats, but a Shih Tzu's idea of fun is sitting in your lap acting adorable as you try to watch TV.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Because of their heavy coats and short faces, Shih Tzu do not tolerate heat well and are not good swimmers. Most Shih Tzu are generally healthy, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as such as hip dysplasia, patellar luxation (a slipped kneecap), eye anomalies including cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, retinal detachment, and corneal dryness and inflammation from excessive exposure to the air because of improperly closing eyelids.","A Shih Tzu with a long coat requires daily brushing. Use a good-quality wire brush with flexible pins, and layer the hair to be sure you reach to the skin. A bath about every three or four weeks will help to keep the coat clean and at its best. Remember to comb the mustache and topknot daily, and gently clean the corner of the  eyes with a damp cloth. To protect the Shih Tzu's eyes from being irritated, the hair on the top of the head should be trimmed short or tied up into a topknot. If you don't want to have to spend time on your dog's coat, the Shih Tzu can look adorable when clipped into a ""puppy trim"" by a professional groomer. Trimming nails and cleaning ears should be part of the Shih Tzu's grooming routine.","The Shih Tzu was bred to be a house companion. As such, they require minimal exercise. Short daily walks with their owner and indoor playtime will satisfy the activity needs of this small, short-legged companion.","Training a Shih Tzu can be both an amusing and a frustrating experience. The breed tends to charm his owner into letting him have his own way, which can result in a chubby, less-than-completely-housebroken pet who is difficult to groom. Because Shih Tzu are such people dogs, training methods based on praise and rewards work best. Harsh corrections should not be used with this breed. Introduce desired new behaviors a bit at a time, be firm, and never give in while the dog is misbehaving. If he nips or jumps up on you, ignore him until he settles down, then praise him. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Shih Tzu grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. When enrolling in a puppy class, be sure that the training methods used in the class are based on positive reinforcement."

The original Shikoku, or Kochi-ken, existed in the mountain ranges of Kochi Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. They were highly valued by the Matagi (Japanese hunters) as a tracker of game, particularly wild boar. He is a medium-sized dog with well-balanced and well-developed, clean-cut muscles. He has pricked ears and a curled or sickle tail. His conformation is strong, well-boned, and compact. His outer coat is rather harsh and straight and his undercoat is soft and dense. The hair on his tail is long. His coat can be red, black and tan, or sesame, which is a well-mixed color of black, red, and white hairs.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","The majority of Shikokus are healthy dogs, and working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Shikoku can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize genetic testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. The strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience, and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.",
237,Siberian-Husky,21-23.5 inches (male),45-60 pounds (male),12-14 years,5,5,5,4,2,1,Double,Medium,5,5,1,4,3,5,5,4,14 of 202,Agouti & White-Black-Black & White-Black Tan & White-Brown & White-Gray & White-Red & White-Sable & White-White,Piebald-Saddle-Back,"Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. Sibes are friendly, fastidious, and dignified.
The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue'¿and sometimes one of each'¿and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute.



 As born pack dogs, they enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can't resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Sibes are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Fortunately, the Siberian Husky is a relatively healthy breed. Responsible breeders screen their breeding stock for health problems such as juvenile cataracts, and the breed's national parent club, the Siberian Husky Club of America, has strict guidelines to help reduce reported cases. Beginning at 12 months of age, all Siberians who potentially will be part of a breeding program should be examined by a canine ophthalmologist. The exam is then repeated on a yearly basis. New screenings and tests are being constantly being developed to help breeders in their selection of a potential dam and sire. Knowledgeable breeding practices ensure the future health of the breed. Owners of working Siberians need to closely monitor each dog to be able to recognize when something just isn't right. Having a veterinarian familiar with working dogs is an advantage.","Siberian Huskies are considered a 'natural' breed. They are remarkably self-cleaning and often need only a few baths a year, unless being shown in conformation dog shows. Weekly brushings help keep the coat and skin in good condition. Siberians have a double coat'¿an undercoat, and guard hair. The undercoat is shed twice a year, and it is important to continually 'rake out' the old coat, using a pin brush and metal comb. Pay close attention to the length of the nails, and keep them trimmed to prevent any foot problems. Siberians competing in conformation require a bit more selective grooming for the best presentation.","Siberians are active, athletic dogs who need a lot of exercise. They are a working breed and happiest when they have a function to perform. Regular exercise is important both physically and mentally, and doing activities together strengthens the bond between dog and owner. Siberians were bred to run and will do so at every opportunity; it is vital to keep the dog on a leash, in harness, or in a fenced yard at all times. There are several AKC-sponsored activities that can be enjoyed by dog and owners'¿rally, agility, and obedience are a few. A busy and active Siberian is a happy and healthy Siberian. This breed is also very adaptable, and for those who live in a more urban setting, daily walks or doggie play groups can provide great exercise.","All breeds benefit from early socialization, basic obedience training, and learning good manners, and the Siberian Husky is no exception. For those owners who want to work their dogs in harness, training for this requires hours of dedication and patience. There are several good books available on training for the trail that provide advice and information on getting started. The best approach is to make all training exercises fun for both dog and handler. Siberians are very social, and regularly need the company of their people or other dogs; they are not suited to being left alone all day. Most importantly, Siberians have an overwhelming desire to run, and they should be on leash or in a securely fenced-in area at all times and never allowed off lead."

The Silky, a native of Sydney, Australia, is larger than his close cousin, the Yorkshire Terrier.
Small but not fragile, feisty but not yappy, pretty but not sculpted, Silkys are 10-inch-tall dynamos animated by curiosity and high spirits. The glorious blue-and-tan coat is straight and glossy, and it feels and behaves much like human hair. The wedge-shaped head is topped by profuse hair parted down the middle, and erect V-shaped ears draw attention to the keen, piercing expression of the almond-shaped eyes. Silkys are more refined than typical ratting terriers, but they should still look and behave like a true earthdog.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","While Silky Terriers are generally healthy dogs, there are several health and genetic screening considerations specific to the breed. Responsible breeders test their stock for conditions the breed can be prone to, including patellar luxation and eye disease. A Silky Terrier's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","The Silky Terrier's coat should be brushed at least twice a week with a pin brush or soft bristle brush. A long-toothed metal dog comb can also come in handy for gently working through areas where tangles may be beginning to form. Left unattended, tangles and mats are uncomfortable for your dog and can cause skin problems to develop. The nails should be trimmed once a month, and a bath every four to six weeks with a gentle shampoo meant for dogs will help to keep the coat and skin clean and healthy. Grooming sessions are a good time to check the dog all over for any new lumps or skin problems, and to check that the eyes and ears are healthy and trouble free.","More a terrier than a lapdog, the Silky Terrier requires more exercise than most Toy Group breeds. Intelligent, bold, and energetic, Silkies need human partners who will know how to channel that energy into daily exercise and training for sports and work. The breed does well in the conformation ring, and Silkies have been successful in companion events, particularly agility.","Silky Terriers can adapt well to any living situation but need owners who have the time to devote to them'¿they do not like to be ignored, preferring to play fetch or go on walks with their family. Taken by the breed's charm, owners may be tempted to let a Silky Terrier get away with undesirable behaviors; it's best to be sure to make rules and stick to them. The breed has a strong prey drive, and a leash is essential when walking outside."

This elegant but sturdy aristocrat was bred as an exterminator on Scotland's remote Isle of Skye.
Long, low, and level, this unique earthdog is among the AKC's most distinctive-looking breeds. Skyes stand 9 or 10 inches high and feature a long, flat-lying coat and peekaboo hairdo. They're known for big, feathery ears that stand up like bat wings, but Skyes can also have 'drop ears,' which lie flat against the large, long head. Beneath the profuse coat are short, muscular legs and a deep chest. When seen in profile, these elegant but substantial terriers are twice as long as they are high.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Because of their long and low structure, Skye Terriers can experience disk injuries, and Skye puppies should never be allowed to go up and down stairs excessively or jump onto hard surfaces from any height. Owners should closely monitor their Skyes for any potential signs of cancer, such as mammary cancer and hemangiosarcoma. Other conditions that responsible breeders screen for include autoimmune disease, skin allergies, hip dysplasia, and luxating patellas.","The Skye's long, luxurious double coat appears more challenging to maintain than it actually is. It does require weekly brushing and combing with a soft or pin brush and a long-toothed comb to keep it free of tangles, but the breed requires no trimming in the form of clippering or scissoring, and the coat should be kept in a natural condition. Nails should be kept trimmed short; usually a trim every couple of weeks to a month is sufficient. Ears should be checked at least weekly and cleaned of any excess wax or debris to avoid ear infections. Baths can be given as needed'¿usually once a month will be enough. Do not scrub the coat during shampooing, as that can cause it to mat.","The Skye Terrier has minimal exercise needs and will usually be content with whatever level of activity is comfortable for his owner. Even a short daily outing will benefit him both physically and mentally. Skyes enjoy play sessions and participating in canine sports with their people, and the breed can be found competing in dog shows and agility, obedience, and earthdog events.","The Skye is a very intelligent but strong-willed breed, calmer than many of the terrier breeds. They are amenable to training, provided it is consistent and done in a positive manner. They are sensitive to correction and will withdraw from harsh or negative training methods. Like all terriers, they can be stubborn, but they enjoy interaction with their humans and are eager to please. The Skye is reserved by nature and should be well socialized from a very young age to ensure a happy and outgoing personality. For those who understand the breed's temperament and raise the dog with love and proper training and socialization, there is no more delightful companion."

The nails should be trimmed regularly as needed, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.","Though usually sedate while in the home, the Sloughi is a somewhat active breed'¿he is a mannerly housedog possessed of high prey drive when in pursuit. This elegant, very athletic hound needs ample exercise, preferably including opportunities to run full out in a safely enclosed area. Canine sports such as lure coursing can engage the breed with mental and physical activity he will greatly enjoy.","The Sloughi is an intelligent and loyal breed that is somewhat aloof. He does best with caring and sensitive owners. Sloughis need ample exercise, and do not respond well to harsh training methods. Despite their athleticism, they are very quiet in the home. Some Sloughis are shy; most are simply very careful and cautious about their personal space. They have a strong sense of self, which shows clearly when they are pursuing games or are strongly challenged. As with most sighthounds, care is necessary when a Sloughi is off lead."

Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking,and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather.

","Like all breeds, there may be some small health issues, but conscientious breeders in both the United States and Europe have made a concerted effort to maintain the health of the breed. Some dogs may be faced with these health challenges in their lives, but the vast majority of Small Munsterlanders are healthy dogs. Regular veterinary care and proper feeding are vital to your dog's health.

Yearly DHLPP vaccinations, rabies shots, a monthly heartworm preventative regimen, and, in many parts of the country, a Lyme Disease vaccination, should not be neglected. Working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Small Munsterlander can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed","Occasional brushings will maintain the quality of the coat with the occasional bath to keep them clean and looking their best. Small Munsterlanders are seasonal shedders and as such it is important to maintain their coats more frequently in the late spring and early fall. Their nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","While Small Munsterlanders make wonderful family companions, they do require frequent exercise and stimulation. The breed was born to hunt and that is the task they are happiest at. This is an all-purpose, versatile hunting breed that was developed to hunt, point, retrieve, and track game.



 The breed's hunting heritage means they have a high activity level and need appropriate outlets for their energy, including daily exercise. If you don't hunt with your Small Munsterlander, be sure to give him other ways to tire himself out, such as going for a run or playing in a fenced area. They need to be supervised outdoors since their instinct is to hunt. If proper stimulation and exercise are not provided, they will wander and self-hunt when left to their own devices.","Like other versatile dogs, this breed is relatively slow to mature. It¿s not until they reach two years of age that most Small Munsterlanders are mentally adult. It¿s important to be prepared for at least one year of a strong and muscular fully-grown dog with the brain of a teenager.

It is important to remember that they are bred as a hunter's helper and also as a family member. These friendly dogs need lots of time and interaction with their human family to reach their full potential and prefer to be raised in the home. As a general rule, Small Munsterlanders are good with kids and are tolerant of a child's unpredictable behavior. However, as with all dogs, it¿s important to socialize them with children and supervise their interactions. It is never suggested to leave a dog alone with small children.

It is also important to find a way to fit your Small Munsterlander into your pastimes. This will give him the chance to spend time with you and work for you, leading to a joyful and well-adjusted companion."

They are close relatives to Wire Fox Terriers.
Smooths are quite similar to their close relatives, Wire Fox Terriers. Like their crispy-coated cousins, Smooths stand no more than 15.5 inches at the shoulder. The distinguishing physical trait, besides coat type, is the head: A Smooth's head is more V-shaped than a Wire's. The dense, flat coat is predominantly white, with black, tan, or black-and-tan markings. These cleverly made hunters are strong and sturdy, but never coarse and clunky. Short-backed and symmetrical, they move with the unwavering grace of a pendulum clock.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Smooth Fox Terriers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders test their stock for health conditions such as patellar luxation and cardiac disease. The teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","The Smooth Fox Terrier's short but hard, dense coat should be groomed weekly with a thick brush or hound glove. A bath every month or so should be sufficient'¿unless the dog follows his nature and ends up digging a hole in the mud, in which case ""bathe as needed"" is the guidance that applies. Nails should be kept trimmed and neat. The ears should be checked weekly to remove any excess wax and or debris, which can cause ear infections, and the teeth should be brushed as often as possible.","Like most terriers, the Smooth Fox Terrier is lively and athletic and requires ample exercise. Long walks with his owner, chasing a tennis ball in the backyard, or playtime in a large, securely fenced area are all great ways to exercise your dog and keep him mentally and physically fit. Never allow your Smooth Fox Terrier to run off-lead, as he is likely to take off if he catches sight of a small animal he perceives as prey.","Smooth Fox Terriers are bold but not aggressive toward people. They make excellent watchdogs in the home. New owners should be aware that the breed's innate sense to dig may affect the family yard or flowerbeds unless the dog is taught otherwise. Alert and 'on the tiptoe of expectations,' Smooths make excellent watchdogs. They are lively, cheerful, and funny. Equally at home in the city or country, they are best kept in a fenced yard or on a lead, as they can eagerly run off to follow any adventure. Some can mature to become jealous or aggressive toward other dogs, cats, or other small pets. Puppy training classes with a sensible, terrier-savvy trainer are highly recommended."
246,Soft-Coated-Wheaten-Terrier,18-19 inches (male),35-40 pounds (male),12-14 years,5,5,3,1,4,2,Wavy-Silky,Medium,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,53 of 202,Wheaten,,"The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, an exuberant Irish farm dog, is happy, friendly, deeply devoted, and just stubborn enough to remind you he's a terrier. The unique wheaten coat is low-shedding but needs diligent care to avoid matting.
The hallmark of these merry extroverts, and what sets them apart from other terriers, is the silky, gently waving coat. It runs from a pale beige to a shimmering gold, recalling the color of ripening wheat. Topping out at 19 inches tall and 40 pounds, Wheatens are square, sturdy terriers with a peek-a-boo hairdo and dashing goatee. The overall picture is that of a hard-muscled but soft-coated working terrier or, as the breed has been described, an iron fist in a velvet glove.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Wheatens are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as protein-losing nephropathy, a kidney ailment; protein-losing enteropathy, a term that is applied to several gastrointestinal conditions; Addison's disease; and renal dysplasia. As with all breeds, a Wheaten's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","The Wheaten's soft, silky coat requires a fair amount of maintenance. The daily grooming session starts with a thorough going-over with a pin brush or a slicker brush to remove dirt and loose hair. Next comes a thorough combing with a medium- and fine-toothed metal comb. Any mats that are found should be pulled apart with the brush, comb, and fingers'¿never with scissors. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier has a medium to high energy level that does not diminish, even in old age. They need plenty of exercise every day. With a strong prey drive, Wheatens will have an urge to chase after just about anything that moves, from squirrels to cars, so the backyard or other play area must be securely fenced, and walks must always be on a leash. Wheatens bond to their owners, who should expect to participate in the daily exercise sessions.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all dogs to help to ensure that the they grow into well-adjusted, well-mannered companions. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is keenly smart and willful, and often has his own agenda. This makes them challenging to train. It also provides another reason why obedience training should start early, before bad habits become ingrained. A Wheaten needs consistent, firm discipline but is sensitive to harsh treatment. Wheatens must be trained to be compliant without breaking their spirit."
247,Spanish-Mastiff,Minimum 28-35 inches,140-200 pounds,10-12 years,5,3,3,3,1,5,Smooth-Double,Short,3,2,5,3,3,3,1,3,,Black-Fawn-Red-Wolfgray-Yellow,White Markings-Brindle Markings,"The Spanish Mastiff is a very intelligent dog, not without beauty, whose expression manifests both these qualities. Rustic, affectionate, kind and noble, he is very determined when facing dangerous animals and in front of strangers, especially when he has the opportunity to defend and protect farms or cattle. In his behaviour, one can see it is a dog sure of himself, determining his strength because he is aware of his enormous power.
The Spanish Mastiff is a dog of great size, well-balanced, very powerful and muscular. He has a massive head and a body covered with a medium-length coat. His bark is raucous, low pitched and deep, very sonorous and audible from a considerable distance. The Spanish Mastiff comes in a range of coat colors, including black, fawn, red, gray, and yellow, and can be seen with brindle or white markings. Used for guarding and defense, the breed is closely related to the seasonal moving of livestock, especially the Merino livestock, which he accompanied at the time of the 'Mesta.' In the Middle Ages, this was an association of sheep ranchers who journeyed seasonally to distant locations to find grazing pastures. The Spanish Mastiff was in charge of defending them against wolves and other predators throughout their travels. Either sedentary or wandering, he performs in the same way for farms, people, and properties in general.

Used as both a herder and waterfowl retriever in his homeland, this rustic charmer is a lively family companion and vigilant watchdog.
The unique look of these inexhaustible workers begins with the coat. It's naturally curly and wooly head to toe, and when grown out will often form tight, tapered cords. In full coat, the facial hair covers the expressive brown eyes. Colors can be black, brown, beige, white, or particolor (black, brown, beige, with white). 'Rustic' is the word often used to describe the overall look of this sturdy dog of medium size (a male will stand a little under 20 inches at the shoulder).","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia and eye anomalies. As with all breeds, the Spanish Water Dog's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, ideally every day, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","The most important basic guidelines for a properly groomed Spanish Water Dog are that the coat is never to be brushed, and it should be the same length all over. Frequency of clipping is up to the owner's preference for the length of hair on their dog, with some owners choosing to let it grow for many months to form cords. While the breed is typically described as having a low-maintenance coat, the cording process does take ongoing attention and some expertise. Because the cording process for this breed is different from that of other corded breeds (such as the Komondor or Bergamasco), owners wanting to undertake this for the first time are encouraged to find someone experienced with Spanish Water Dog coats. The breed's national parent club, the Spanish Water Dog Club of America, has members on its e-mail list who are always willing to give advice and help.","Spanish Water Dogs benefit from a good run at least once a day. Once they have reached full maturity and the bone growth plates are closed, they have the capacity for lengthy, strenuous exercise and make great companions for activities such as running, hiking, or snow-shoeing. With their moderate size and natural athleticism, they enjoy being active, but they also have a good ""off switch"" for more settled time at home. SWDs are usually strong swimmers, and playing fetch in the water is a great way to burn off energy without the risk of injury that repetitive impact through retrieving on land can cause.","This is a highly intelligent and active (both mentally and physically) breed. They thrive on the problem-solving nature of positive training using a clicker or similar training style. SWDs are extremely biddable and willing to please and are showing themselves to be highly capable and very versatile. Harsh training methods may cause the SWD to lose his enthusiasm for the tasks asked of him, and he may ""shut down."" Potential owners are reminded that as herding dogs, some SWDs have a very high prey drive. They need a reliable recall. Even with diligent training, some will not be able to resist the temptation of a squirrel, rabbit, or deer. The temperament of the Spanish Water Dog deserves special consideration. These dogs are very loyal to their owners but can be quite wary of strangers. Ongoing socialization as well as positive new experiences are essential from an early age."

Of ancient Italian lineage, the Spinone is among the field dogs of Continental Europe famed for versatility.
The Spinone Italiano (plural: Spinoni Italiani) is a squarely and solidly built all-around hunter. Spinoni are muscular and powerful, built more for endurance than speed. The dense coat has a natural, unclippered look and comes in various colors and patterns. The face conveys the breed's abundant Old World charm. Those soft, sweetly expressive eyes set off by shaggy eyebrows and a tufted beard have won many a heart in Italy'¿and they're making new conquests here in America every day.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia and eye anomalies. As with all breeds, the Spinone's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, ideally every day, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","Despite the standard saying that the breed should be ""kept in a natural state,"" Spinoni do need some grooming. They should be hand-stripped, rather than scissored, to get out the dead hair, as well as maintain a coat length of one and a half to two and a half inches. Spinone need their ears cleaned at least once a week. The legs should be kept in a brushy column, and no feathers left on the tail. Nails should be trimmed once a week.","Spinoni are 'low octane' compared to other sporting breeds. While a hike or walk is always a good idea, it is not something that must be done every day. A large, securely fenced yard and plenty of playtime will keep a Spinone happy, along with being part of the family, which is just as important to his well-being as exercise. Spinoni are not ""kennel dogs,"" or dogs who can just be left alone outside'¿they must be part of the family at all times, which means being a house dog, living inside with the family.","One experienced breeder shares insight on breed trainability: 'Spinoni are very soft, very stubborn, and very smart. Training is mostly about '¿barter.' With many breeds, if you say, '¿Jump,' they will ask, '¿How high?' as they are jumping, whereas a Spinone will ask, '¿Why?' You can teach a Spinone the basics and even train them for competitive obedience'¿just don't expect them to be '¿high and tight' about it every single time. They may tell you, '¿No, not today. Maybe later.' They are smart, but a challenge, and they will shut down if training is too hard or harsh. When hunting, they hunt where they want and will put food on your table. Spinoni are not '¿robot hunters' who will go where you tell them to. Spinoni teach hunters to trust their dogs in the field.'"
250,Stabyhoun,19-21 inches,40-60 pounds,13-15 years,5,5,4,3,1,2,Smooth-Double,Short,3,3,3,3,5,4,3,4,,Black & White-Brown & White-Orange & White,Ticked-Spotted-Roan,"Although occasionally somewhat willful by nature, Stabyhouns are obedient, gentle, and patient dogs, who are deeply fond of their family, wanting to please their owners. He is both a soft-mouthed retriever and a pointer that is particularly useful for hunting ducks and upland birds. He is a fine retriever, and water work is one of his fortes. He is very sharp-eyed, owns a good sense of smell and aptitude, and works fast and efficiently.
The Stabyhoun's independent nature was a deliberately bred characteristic by farmers who wanted a dog that could hunt independently for moles and rabbits. That propensity we still see today, therefore, you cannot be upset if he looks for prey independently and, for example, digs in the garden. With proper guidance, a Staby is a gentle dog and a great friend for life.



 Stabys are also very inquisitive. Always pay attention to what a Stabyhoun is up to because with their inquisitive nature, they can quickly get into trouble. If you think your Staby will sit quietly if something happens, you will often be disappointed. Although Stabys make a lot of noise when something is wrong or to alert his owner, they generally expect the owner to further investigate before they accept that things are normal. Most Stabys will need to verify that there are no ""surprises"" in store before calming down again.



 This breed is a functional and powerfully-built pointing dog that originated in the Netherlands. The majority of Stabyhouns are black and white. The brown and white coloring is seen in the Netherlands, but the orange and white Stabyhoun is nearly extinct. The Staby's build is such that it is greater in length than in height and similarly, the head shows more length than width. The feathering on his chest, collar, forelegs, trousers and tail gives the Staby the impression of being longhaired, but the coat is not excessively long. The Stabyhoun is considered to be an ""all-around"" dog, with abilities in hunting, retrieving, and pointing. They are also ideal family dogs because of their size and affectionate character.

","The Stabyhoun is, despite its small population, fortunately a relatively healthy breed. The ASA and the NVSW do everything possible to keep it that way. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as epilepsy, hip and elbow dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and cerebral dysfunction. The ASA's breeding program is aimed to reduce these occurrences as much as possible, though it is not easy, as the causes are not always clear or strictly hereditary.","A Stabyhoun's grooming needs are almost nonexistent. Unless he is neutered, any necessary hair trimming can be done yourself. A neutered dog also comes with what is called a ""castrated coat"" where the undercoat is exploding and may require a bit more grooming.



 Otherwise, the medium-length coat of the Stabyhoun is self-cleaning, meaning dirt falls off by itself when the coat is dry. One brush through it to remove the last remnants of sand and he is clean again. This also means that he only rarely gets a bath. Even if he really is very dirty, just a rinse or a swim in a clean pool is usually sufficient. Shampoo is only required if he has been rolling in something smelly; then, use a special, neutral dog shampoo so as not to strip his skin oils.","Daily exercise is necessary for the mental and physical health of your Staby. They do not require more than a good daily hour of exercise. Afterward, they are then content to sleep and rest quietly during the day. What is perhaps even more important is that the Staby needs a mental challenge. Stabys need to have a function in daily life, and preference should be given to something that offers variety. Agility, hunting, scent training, and lure coursing can all be productive and stimulating to your Staby. A busy dog is the perfect dog.","Stabys are self-motivated and quick learners. The reason for this lies mainly in the fact that the Staby had to work independently to destroy pests, so it was handy to have a real ""thinker."" That suited the breed well at a time when there were few outside influences and hardly any traffic.



 With positive and gentle training, the Staby is quick to learn and wants to please. Too much pressure is never a good idea, while a good coach is important. The Staby likes a job, but his family must provide a fair and consistent approach to his training, which is very important for a peaceful, happy and diverse education. A tough approach is useless with the Staby. He will completely cease working and no longer voluntarily perform his duties."

Happily, good breeding transformed this former gladiator into a mild, playful companion with a special feel for kids.
At 14 to 16 inches, Staffies do not stand particularly tall. But, weighing anywhere between 24 to 38 pounds, Staffies pour a gallon of dog into a quart-size container. These are rock-solid, muscular terriers. The head is short and broad, with pronounced cheek muscles, and the tight-fitting coat comes in several colors.     Staffies still resemble the pugnacious brawlers who once ruled England's fighting pits. But today's responsible breeders are producing sweet-natured, family-oriented Staffies with a reputation for being a patient nanny dog for kids. These are true-blue loyal companions, but the old fighting instinct still lurks within, making it vital that Staffie pups be socialized with other dogs to learn good canine manners.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, patellar luxation and eye anomalies including hereditary juvenile cataracts, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), and posterior polar subcapsular cataracts (PPSC). SBTs can develop several forms of skin allergies, some of which may be genetic. The DNA test for L-2-HGA, a metabolic condition, allows breeders to identify carriers and avoid producing affected offspring. Be an informed owner, and discuss any health questions or concerns with your dog's breeder and your veterinarian.","It doesn't take much work to keep a Staffordshire Bull Terrier looking handsome. Occasional baths and weekly brushings with a horsehair mitt or hound glove to pull away dead hairs will keep him in beautiful condition. His nails should be trimmed at least monthly. Avoid letting them grow out too long, as overly long nails can be quite painful for him. Clean the ears regularly to remove excess wax and debris, which can cause an ear infection. Your breeder and your veterinarian can suggest a good routine and cleaning materials and will show you how to do it without damaging his inner ear.","The Stafford requires regular exercise to stay mentally and physically fit. This exercise can be chasing a ball tossed across the backyard, running alongside a biking or jogging owner, or just a nice, long hike through the woods. Although a Stafford in good physical condition can keep up with an athletic owner, they usually settle right in when they come back in the house after a good exercise session. The breed can be heat intolerant and should never be overworked in warm or humid weather.","The Stafford is intelligent, learns easily, responds quickly, is calmly protective, and can be a loving and fun companion. They have an ardent desire to please and easily comply with the requests of their owners. However, remember that they were originally bred to fight other dogs, and most have retained a strong prey drive. They must be trained to control their temperament traits to truly become a perfect pet. It is imperative that from the beginning a Stafford puppy have clear and consistent training. They should not only learn the rules, but also accept that they must always follow them."

Schnauzers of all three sizes share several breed hallmarks: a wiry, tight-fitting coat of pure black or 'pepper and salt'; a robust, square-built frame; and an elongated head furnished with arched eyebrows and bristly whiskers, framing eyes gleaming with keen intelligence.



 Standards are sociable companions, alert watchdogs, enthusiastic backyard squirrel chasers, and are good with kids and protective of loved ones.

","According to the health surveys the Standard Schnauzer Club of America does every five years, SS are a very healthy breed. SS are mostly free of many health concerns that affect other breeds. Breeders are conscientious about testing for health concerns such as hip dysplasia and eye disorders,and registering the results with the OFA at the University of Missouri. The new DNA test for cardiomyopathy (which in SS is a simple recessive) allows breeders to identify carriers and breed them to non-carriers so they can eliminate the expression of the disease in the breed.","Standard Schnauzers require regular grooming. Washing beards and leg furnishings, dental care, keeping foreign materials from between foot pads, and nail trims are weekly tasks. SS have a double coat; if the harsh, wiry outer coat is clippered instead of hand-stripped, it loses its dirt-, bramble-, and water resistance, which results in more dirt and shedding of hair in the house. Clippering the coat also makes the coat soft, and each clippering lightens the coat color. Once a coat has been hand-stripped, it can be maintained over a long period of time simply by regular brushing and plucking out long hairs.","Standard Schnauzers are an energetic breed. They love to play, both with their people and with other dogs. They insist on being included in family activities and don't do well left out alone or tied up in the yard. The love long hikes with their people. They're excellent at performance sports such as agility, barn hunt, herding, and lure coursing. As long as their person enjoys an activity, most SS will participate with enthusiasm.","Early socialization in puppyhood is a must. Standard Schnauzers are extremely intelligent, wily, and crafty. They ""get"" an idea or an exercise with very few repetitions. A big problem with SS is over-training; after a few repetitions, they get bored and look at the trainer as though the trainer is stupid. Because of their intelligence, they do require training'¿and if their person doesn't teach them, they learn on their own, but it may not be what the owner wants the dog to learn."
253,Sussex-Spaniel,13-15 inches,35-45 pounds,13-15 years,5,3,3,3,3,3,Double,Medium,3,4,3,4,4,3,3,3,180 of 202,Golden Liver,,"""Placid, affectionate, even-tempered, true-blue, loyal,"" all are words used to describe the Sussex Spaniel, a slow-but-steady hunter, and congenial housedog. His frowning expression is delightfully at odds with a typically cheerful nature.
Looking a bit like a cross between a Cocker Spaniel and a torpedo, Sussex are long, low-built bird dogs of great strength and endurance. Topping out at just 15 inches tall at the shoulder, Sussex are nonetheless described as 'massive,' with a deep chest and heavy bone. Their trademark is an abundant, feathery coat of rich golden-liver. The classic spaniel head, with its wavy-coated ears and big hazel eyes, projects a somber, frowning expression delightfully at odds with the Sussex's innate cheerfulness.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Sussex are difficult to breed, and bitches often skip seasons, re-absorb puppies, and need C-sections. Puppies are fragile until about two weeks of age. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as heart problems. Bloat can affect some Sussex, and cancer occurs in mostly older dogs. A genetic test is now available for pdp1, a heritable metabolic, allowing breeders to identify carriers and avoid producing affected offspring.","General grooming for the breed is simply bathing, brushing, and combing. The hair on the bottoms of the feet should be trimmed to keep the dog from slipping. If the dog is neutered, the coat becomes fuzzy and cotton-candy like, and is much harder to deal with. The Sussex should not be shaved down unless absolutely necessary, as it takes a long time for the coat to recover. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly.","The Sussex Spaniel should not have strenuous exercise before he is at least a year old. Sussex are slow growing, and exercise too early can damage the growth plates. Puppies should be allowed to self-exercise by playing. Adult Sussex love swimming and long walks, but jumping and agility-type work should not start until the dog is at least 18 months old.","Sussex can be stubborn; they have long memories and will never forget nor forgive rough handling. Sussex owners should strive to convey to the dog clearly what they want, and give the dog lots of praise when he gets it right."
254,Swedish-Lapphund,16-20 inches,30-45 pounds,12-14 years,5,3,3,3,2,2,Double,Long,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,,Black-Liver,White Markings,"Lively, alert, kind and affectionate. The Lapphund is very receptive, attentive and willing to work. Its abilities as a good herding dog made it very useful in the reindeer trade. It is very versatile, suitable for obedience training, agility, herding, tracking, etc. It is easy to train, full of endurance and toughness.
Swedish Lapphunds make wonderful family companions and thrive when included in all the activities of their human pack. This lively and intelligent medium-sized spitz is a versatile, playful, and energetic pooch. Although generally considered a medium to high energy breed, it is capable of relaxing and chilling when appropriate, aka the Lappie 'on/off' switch. Alert and friendly, they can also be independent-minded and stubborn. The breed retains its guarding and herding traits of alertness and attention-getting barking. The Swedish Lappie is eager to please, will work with you, and is suited for rally, agility, herding, scent work, and other companion events.

","Swedish Lapphunds are generally a healthy breed. Responsible breeders will test for hip dysplasia and PRA and will have health information readily available on their dogs. Working with a responsible breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed.","The Lappie has a medium-length, double coat that should be kept in good condition with weekly brushing and an occasional bath. Swedish Lappies undergo a heavy shedding of their undercoat at least once or twice per year, referred to as 'blowing coat.' A groomer can be helpful at this time to deal with the large amount of fur that is shed. Under no circumstances should a Swedish Lapphund ever be shaved. The coat should always be maintained at its natural length year round.","Swedish Lapphunds are a medium-high-energy breed and benefit from daily exercise. They do have an 'on/off' switch; that is to say, they are very energetic, alert, and active, but capable of settling down and relaxing. This is an intelligent and active breed requiring regular mental and physical exercise to prevent boredom. It is not a breed to be left alone for long periods, and when outdoors a fenced yard is a must. As with most breeds, a bored Lappie will find his way into mischief.","Swedish Lapphunds have an eager and curious nature, resulting in a high level of trainability. With the challenge of an independent mind and occasional stubborn streak, training a Lappie requires a light hand, patience, and a sense of humor. He is well-suited for herding, agility, obedience, and other canine sports."

These rugged cattle dogs are known for their zest for life, unique vocalizations, and cheerful demeanor.
With their thick sable coat, sturdy construction, and overall no-frills look, Vallhunds are a timeless breed, as comfortable in a suburban backyard as they were on the prow of Viking longships 1,200 years ago. These lively herders are built long and low the ground in not quite as exaggerated a fashion as their distant cousins the corgis, but the idea is the same: Their build makes it easier to nip at the heels of cattle and avoid kicks to the head. Balance, power, and smooth movement are breed hallmarks.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
",Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia. A genetic test for an eye issue called Swedish Vallhund retinopathy was developed in 2017; breeders can now identify carriers and breed them accordingly to ensure they do not produce affected offspring.,"Swedish Vallhunds need a good, down-to-the-skin brushing occasionally and a  bath when they get dirty. They shed their undercoat twice a year, which will make you wonder just how many dogs you have, going by the snowdrifts of hair. Vallhunds are very easy dogs to manage when it comes to grooming. When they are shedding, a warm bath and good massage when shampooing, followed by drying with a dryer and a thorough brushing, can get rid of the worst of it.","There is quite a bit of individual variability in terms of exercise needs in the breed. Some Swedish Vallhunds have more energy than others. Keep in mind that while this isn't a breed intended to run all day, the Vallhund is a working farm dog and needs regular exercise. One decent walk daily with some time playing fetch or performing a sport or other activity is likely adequate for most Vallhunds, but some need more. They also need mental exercise in addition to their physical exercise. Puzzle games, clicker training, and participating in a sport can all contribute to their mental and physical well-being.","Most Vallhunds should want to work with you; that's one of the hallmarks of the breed. They do best with positive, reward-based training, since most just need to understand what you want. Keep in mind that this is a cattle-herding breed. They're strong willed (as they need to be to do their job), and your goal should be to get the dog to work happily with you. Most do extremely well with clicker training, and most are very biddable."

He is a medium-sized dog with triangular head, almond shaped eyes, thin pricked ears and a sickle tail.
The Taiwan Dog's intuitive nature and connection to its master were most likely honed from generations of collaboratively hunting small game in the mountains. This also means that they are extremely responsive to commands and easily trained. This breed can be reserved towards strangers and are fearless in protecting their family. Therefore, socialization for the Taiwan dog is necessary to mediate its strong instinct to protect its master and family. They should be an integral part of the family household and not an outside dog as they excel with daily interaction and socialization.

With his strong protective nature and well-developed pack instincts, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier gets along well with children (when raised with them), cats, and other dogs. He is a bold, tenacious hunter with seemingly unlimited energy whose size and endurance makes him an excellent hunter of squirrels and vermin.
Teddy Roosevelt Terriers are delightful companions in the home. They learn quickly and are ready for any activity their owners engage in. While they will still keep the family farm and home free of rats and mice, the job for which they were bred, they also excel in companion sports such as agility and obedience. They get along with other dogs without belligerence and have retained their prey drive without obsessive compulsion. At the end of the day, they love nothing better than to share the love and companionship of their owners. Teddies can adapt to pretty much any lifestyle, whether you show in conformation rings, work in agility trials, or just want a great companion for your home or farm. Their small to medium size makes them suitable for apartment living as well. This loyal, active and playful breed is at its best as a member of its human family.

The Thai Ridgeback is a muscular, medium-sized dog with a stream-lined body that makes him very agile and a natural athlete. The ridge on his back is formed by hair growing in the opposite direction from the rest of his coat and the breed has up to 8 different ridge patterns. Puppies can be born without this ridge. Coat colors include solid blue, black, red or fawn with a black mask occasionally on the red-coated dogs. Thai Ridgebacks also have spotted tongues and some even come with solid black/blue tongues. Today, most Ridgebacks are companion dogs, but they still maintain many of the same instincts for the jobs for which they were bred: hunting and guarding. They had to be independent, self-sufficient and hunt for their own food, which gave them strong survival instincts, a high prey drive, and a high level of intelligence. If well-bred and properly socialized, the Thai Ridgeback can be a loyal, loving pet. As a guarding breed, they are naturally protective of their home and can be reserved and suspicious with strangers. Thai Ridgebacks will need a patient, consistent, and experienced owner with a good understanding of dog behavior; they are not for first-time dog owners.

These densely coated giants are mellow and calm around the house, sweetly devoted to family, and aloof and territorial with strangers.
Coming face to face with this ancient behemoth, an intruder up to no good will likely move on to easier pickings. TMs can stand 26 inches at the shoulder and weigh well over 100 pounds. It's impossible to discuss this breed without leaning on words like 'powerful,' 'muscular,' massive,' and 'substantial.' And yet, TMs are quite light-footed and will meet a perceived threat with surprising agility. The broad head, with its high-set, V-shaped ears and expressive brown eyes, projects a noble, sagacious expression.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Tibetan Mastiff is a relatively healthy breed, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and eye anomalies including entropion and ectropion. Seizures have been reported, but the issue is not prevalent in the breed.","Tibetan Mastiffs are double coated, with a heavy, wooly undercoat and coarse guard hair. They have a low-maintenance coat that requires minimal grooming during the majority of the year. A weekly brushing with a slicker or a long pin brush to remove surface dirt and the use of a wide-tooth comb on the tail, mane, and breeches to remove tangles are all that is required. TMs 'blow' their undercoat once a year in a massive shedding in late spring or summer. During this time, it is best to use an undercoat rake or de-shedding tool. According to the breed standard, TMs are to be shown naturally; no clipping or trimming is acceptable except to shape the feet and to give a clean appearance to the hocks.","Tibetan Mastiffs need daily moderate exercise, but it does not need to be in the form of an organized activity. TMs prefer to focus on work-related tasks, such as patrolling their territory, rather than structured play, such as chasing a flying disc or playing fetch. They are more active in cooler weather. They tend to conserve energy until needed, exhibiting only short bursts of activity, and lack endurance. They make good throw-rugs in winter, and air-conditioner vent covers in summer!","Tibetan Mastiffs do not respond well to traditional obedience training. They are highly intelligent, learn quickly, and do not feel the need to repeat what they already know. They will do what their owners ask of them  they respect and trust their judgment'¿but if there is ever a question, the TM will follow his instincts over training. In general the breed is not food driven, and they do not reliably respond to treats as a training tool. They are also notorious for performing impeccably in class and then completely ignoring all commands when they are once again at home. They do not have reliable recall and should never be trusted off leash."

Known for a flat, silky coat and 'lion's mane' around the neck, the Tibbie forms a tight, worshipful bond with their humans.
With a blunt muzzle and big expressive eyes, a 'lion's mane' around the neck, and a plumed tail elegantly curving over the back, they're distinctly Tibetan. But are they spaniels? No, not in the Western sense, like Cockers or Cavaliers. Instead, Tibbies recall the ancient traditions that produced Pekes, Pugs, Lhasas, and other unmistakably Asian breeds. Tibbies stand about 10 inches at the shoulder; they move quickly and with purpose. They're seen in coats of many colors and combinations.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","Tibetan Spaniels are a relatively health breed, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as progressive retinal atrophy (a genetic eye disease); 'cherry eye,' an inflammation of tissue adjacent to the eye that often is corrected surgically; and patellar luxation. Before going to their new homes, puppies should be checked for portosystemic shunt (liver shunt), in which the blood flow around and/or through the liver is affected.","Whether show or pet, the Tibetan Spaniel is a natural breed that does not require trimming except for the hair on the bottom of their feet, for cleanliness. The area behind the ears tends to mat and should be combed frequently, but otherwise the breed's coat does not tend to mat. A regular brushing and bath will keep the coat in good condition, with attention also given to the rear fringes, which can use a regular combing. Tibetan Spaniels do shed, and can do a good shed any time of the year. A bath and conditioning can help at this time. If the Tibbie is taken to a groomer, they should be advised to not cut the hair on the belly or between the legs. Many groomers regularly do a 'sanitary cut' unless the owner advises them not to. Tibetan Spaniels will lick and itch badly if a sanitary cut is done. Nails should be trimmed as puppies, training the Tibbie to get used to regular nail trimming. They can be very bad about their nails unless worked with early.","A daily walk is always enjoyable to a Tibetan Spaniel. They are as happy lying around the house as they are taking a long run in the yard. A fenced yard is a must. They are a great breed for owners who would like a dog to accompany them on long walks or jogs, as they are able to keep up with their human partner.","Tibetan Spaniels are smart and eager to please, and can excel in canine activities such as agility, scent work, rally, and obedience. They have a very independent mind, however, and will decide if and when they will do what is asked of them, so an early start to training is needed, and it should be a fun and enjoyable time. Socialization in puppyhood is a must as well."

A profusely coated, small-to-medium-sized dog with 'snowshoe' feet, the TT is affectionate, sensitive, and clever.
Bearing a passing resemblance to their smaller cousin, the Lhasa Apso, Tibetan Terriers reside at the lower end of medium-sized breeds, standing about 15 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 20 and 24 pounds. A breed hallmark is the beautiful and profuse double coat'¿wooly underneath, with a long, fine topcoat. TTs are unique among dogs for their large, flat 'snowshoe' feet, adapted over centuries to help them negotiate the snowy, mountainous terrain of their homeland.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","TTs can be a hardy, healthy breed that ages gracefully. But just as second-generation immigrants to Western countries succumb to Western diseases, the same phenomenon might be linked to the shift in TT health issues due to environmental changes in diet and lifestyle from its country of origin. Early spay and neuters can predispose dogs to joint issues. Many breeders request that the dog reach maturity before altering. Geriatric heart murmurs and cataracts are not uncommon in aging TTs. Occasionally senior TTs are struck with vestibular disease, which is fortunately something from which they can recover. Cancer is an increasing concern in aging TTs. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as allergies, thyroid issues, bladder stones, periodontal disease, hip and patella issues. Genetic tests (such as for NCL, LL, PRA, etc.) are a valuable tool used by breeders to eliminate the expression of those diseases in their puppies.","Prospective TT owners may mistakenly think this is not the dog for them based upon the manicured, flowing coats seen on televised dog shows. But there's an agile, versatile dog underneath with a multi-purpose coat suited for everyday life. TTs have a double coat, the undercoat being wool, resistant to moisture and a natural insulator. Coat textures can vary from softer to harder to more or less prone to matting. The natural coat of the breed can stand up to most anything nature can dish out. It may be convenient to keep the dog in a puppy cut if a full coat hinders desired outdoor adventures. That being said, the real benefit of grooming a TT is that it strengthens the bond in relationship, is great training, and is a way to monitor the dog's health. It may come as a surprise how enjoyable grooming can be.","TTs love to take walks and be outdoors with their people. Individuals within the breed may have more or less drive for exercise. A good breeder will be able to place match each prospective owner with a compatible dog. If you want to hike up a mountain, there's a TT for that. If you're more of a homebody and simply walk around the block or take the stairs a couple times a day, there's a TT for that. Many TTs enjoy a post in the house where they can look out a window or door and perform sentry duty for their household. If this spot is an overlook like a stair landing or balcony, all the better.","This is an independent-minded breed that is quick to learn and will wither under obsessive repetition or harsh methods. Training practices that allow the dog to choose the right behavior are recommended. Clicker-training instruction is widely available, and both human and dog will enjoy the developing partnership from training together. TTs are enthusiastic students who love working closely with their owner (in things such as agility, rally, and nose work) and performing jobs that contribute to the household. They seek companionship based on mutual cooperation, trust, and respect. They have great capacity for love and devotion to their people."

When standing and moving, he is strong, harmonious and well-balanced. His coat is long and thick. According to studies, the Tornjak is most likely a descendant of the Tibetan Mastiff, or from the area where modern-day Iran is. That environment has created a healthy and strong watchdog, with modest needs for food and shelter. Tornjaks are friendly with people, but aggressive towards other animals and dogs that threaten his owner, home, sheep, pen or flock.

Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, or retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather.

He is normally a tranquil, quiet, and obedient dog, with a calm but vigilant demeanor. With a stately manner and robust build, they were formerly bred for fighting, but are now used as watchdogs.
The Tosa is quietly affectionate with his own family, but may be somewhat aloof with strangers. This breed is also, by nature, watchful of other dogs and may react aggressively to dogs it considers intruders. Overtly aggressive behavior towards humans is uncharacteristic of the breed. Their short, dense coat can be fawn, red, apricot, black or brindle and they can also have white markings on their chest and feet. In addition, Tosas mature slowly and individual dogs may not reach their prime until as late as four years of age. This breed is the largest of all Japanese dog breeds. They are also known as the Tosa Ken, Tosa Dog, Tosa Token, Tosa Inu, Japanese Fighting Dog, and Japanese Mastiff.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

Working with a responsible breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed.","The Tosa's short, dense coat requires little grooming, and the occasional brushing will suffice. Beyond that, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Their strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. The ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Tosas are, by nature, a rather calm breed, though even low-energy breeds need some exercise in order to maintain a healthy weight and get mental stimulation. Options for exercise could include run time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities like chasing a ball rolled along the floor or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like hiking or retrieving balls can provide a good outlet for expending energy, too. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience, and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.",The Tosa responds best to positive-reinforcement training methods because of his inherent desire to please his owner.

Responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as patellar luxation and eye disease.  The dog's anal glands must be checked often, and the teeth need to be cared for regularly.","The Toy Fox Terrier requires minimal grooming. Shedding is helped along by using a small shedding comb or a gentle hound glove. The breed needs only an occasional bath. The owner should start grinding or trimming the pup's toenails at a young age if possible, so that he will be accustomed to the procedure.","Quick, alert, and athletic, Toy Fox Terriers like running and romping. They enjoy walking, running, and hiking outdoors when they have the chance. On 'days off,' they are happy to run laps in the living room! Kids especially are charmed by the unending energy and zeal for play throughout this dog's life, but as with all toy breeds, they are not recommended for small children. Their small size makes them ideal for an apartment, although they love to explore the outdoors.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all dogs and help to ensure that the Toy Fox Terrier grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. Housebreaking can involve just training the puppy to go outside, or it can include training him the use of a potty pad indoors, which can be very helpful for travel or during inclement weather conditions. Toy Fox Terriers are content and capable of any range of activities from hunting, to obedience, to just lounging around in the sun (or on the sofa).

At his foundation, he is quiet and even, but also determined and lively. The environmental conditions of the Carpathians made the breed a tough, brave dog.
The Transylvanian Hound is an ancient Hungarian hunter created by special climate, terrain, and hunting conditions. His whole appearance reflects nobility and harmony. Due to his medium size, his body is athletic, lean, muscular, and exaggerated, and his movement is balanced and elegant. Its basic nature is calm, balanced yet firm, temperamental, and adaptable. Their playful nature makes them an ideal family favorite. Because of their balance and friendliness, they can be kept both in an apartment or house. His courage and loyalty make him a good guard. This scent hound is a basic dog, but it can also be used for retrieval. Hunting in a group or alone, you will hear a far-ranging, high, ringing tone indicating the direction of the game.

The strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly and kept short with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. The ears should be checked occasionally to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed when needed.","The Transylvanian Hound is a very active breed. Plan for at least an hour-long walk or run daily. Remember that the urge to chase game may be more powerful than the attachment to his master. For this reason, walking without a leash is not advisable and off-leash romps must be in areas that are securely enclosed. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience, and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.","The Transylvanian Hound is primarily a hunting dog who can hardly resist his ancient instincts, so it is very important to train him appropriately.

They are intelligent, brave, courageous and loyal companions with a strong inbred instinct for hunting. The breed bays during a hunt, which means they cry out to the hunter.
The Treeing Tennessee Brindle originated in the United States, most notably the areas in and around the Appalachian and Ozark Mountains. They are bred from Cur dogs with a focus to have great scenting power, be an open trailer with good voice, and retain the uncanny ability to tree all kinds of game. Brindle-colored, smaller in size, and with a shorter ear, they are different in conformation than the Plott.

","The Treeing Walker is overall quite a healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia and eye anomalies. Be sure to always check the dog's ears when he comes in from outside, as ticks love to burrow beneath the coonhound's floppy ears. Removing excess ear wax and debris and checking the ears at least weekly will help you to avoid common ear infections.","The Treeing Walker is a very low-maintenance breed. His short, smooth coat repels dirt and mud, and he will require only the occasional bath to maintain his handsome appearance. Wiping him down with a damp towel or a hound glove will keep his coat shining. His nails should be trimmed every couple of weeks, as long nails can cause the dog discomfort and structural problems. A hound's ears should be cleaned regularly to keep them free of excess wax or debris and to check for any signs of ear infection. The Treeing Walker will look forward to grooming sessions as bonding experiences with the human he loves.","Like most coonhounds, the Treeing Walker is a high-energy breed who delights in stretching his legs in a good, long run. He is an excellent candidate for someone who wants a running or hiking companion. While most coonhounds can quite happily become couch potatoes, most will still appreciate long daily walks at a minimum. Romps in the backyard, chasing a ball, or playing with human or canine friends will help to keep him mentally and physically healthy. The Treeing Walker has a very high prey drive and should be on a leash for walks and hikes, as he may be unable to resist the instinct to pursue an interesting scent.","The Treeing Walker Coonhound is very intelligent and eager to learn. These hounds love to please their people, but they also have a stubborn, independent streak. This can make them seem difficult to a trainer who doesn't understand the coonhound brain. Keeping training lessons fun and entertaining and praising good behavior and jobs well done with treats as well as effusive praise will result in a hound who is a joy to live with."

The Vizsla is easily recognized by his sleek golden-rust coat. They can stand between 21 to 24 inches at the shoulder and are the picture of a lean, light-footed hunter's companion. The long, silky ears frame a facial expression that is sensitive and loving around the house and intense when at work.



 As a hunter expected to work closely with humans, Vizslas form a tight bond with their owners and hate to be left alone.



 Athletes of many talents, Vizslas excel at various sports and activities. They are eager and graceful trotters of great stamina, making them ideal jogging or biking companions.

","Vizslas are generally a healthy breed. A typical lifespan is about 12 to 15 years. As in all breeds'¿and in mixed breeds'¿cancers are a concern. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as such as seasonal allergies; eye disorders, including melanosis or entropion; hip dysplasia; epilepsy; and ear infections. Careful breeders do their homework ahead of time for the best odds of producing sound, healthy pups.","Vizslas have a short, sleek coat with no undercoat, so they don't require complicated grooming. They do shed, and occasional brushing with a rubber grooming brush is helpful. When they get especially dirty (or when they roll in something smelly), they will need a bath with lukewarm water, a good-quality dog soap, and thorough rinsing. It is important to keep the toenails short, either with a clipper or with a grinding tool. Ears should be checked frequently for dirt, wax build-up, or signs of irritation. Regular use of a mild ear-cleaning product will help prevent problems. To keep teeth and gums healthy, regular cleaning is recommended; use a product formulated for dogs (not human toothpaste).","Vizslas were bred to be active hunting dogs, and they need both physical and mental exercise. Individual dogs' needs vary, but, in general, owners should plan on a minimum of 30 minutes of active exercise daily'¿and some dogs will need more than that. In addition to leash walks and games of fetch, most Vizslas need opportunities to run hard off-leash on a regular basis. Mental exercise is as important as physical activity, so training should be part of their routine. Vizslas can be excellent running or jogging companions, with the caveat that young dogs should not run long distances until they reach maturity at about 18 to 24 months. Older Vizslas typically remain active and playful.","Vizslas need consistent, positive training, starting in puppyhood. They are highly intelligent, curious, and sometimes manipulative, so owners need to establish solid communication and teach good behavior. Untrained Vizslas are hard to live with. They can find many creative ways get into trouble if they don't have a 'job.' Fortunately, they typically love training and thrive on the attention they receive. This is a sensitive breed, so early and ongoing socialization is important to make sure the dog has the confidence to enjoy various activities. With good socialization and consistent training, there are countless ways to have fun with these versatile dogs, including field trials, hunting tests, conformation, obedience, rally, agility, dock diving, barn hunts, lure coursing, scent work, and tracking."

Volpini have existed since ancient times and almost became extinct when Italy lost interest in the breed. American Eskimo Dog breeders bred the Volpino Italiano to their Eskies in an effort to create the toy-sized American Eskimo. In the 1960s, Italian breeders took new interest to prevent the extinction of their breed and, as a result, the Volpino Italiano experienced a resurgence and remains a viable breed.

Instantly recognized by a distinctive silvery-gray coat, male Weimaraners stand 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder, and females 23 to 25 inches. A properly bred Weimaraner will be solid colored, with maybe a small white spot on the chest. The face, with its amber or blue-gray eyes framed by long velvety ears, is amiable and intelligent. Overall, the breed presents a picture of streamlined grace and balance. A well-conditioned Weimaraner on point is a breathtaking sight.



 Weimaraners are excellent with kids and yearn to be full-fledged family members.

","Being a very active breed, Weimaraners get more than their share of accidental cuts, scrapes, sprains, and pulls. They love to chew, and that makes for mouth and gum injury. Be careful of them ingesting things that should not go down a dog' s throat. The most serious health issue in the breed is gastric torsion. This is a life-threatening condition where the stomach gets overstretched and twists shut. Discuss the symptoms with your vet so you can recognize them, and seek immediate veterinary care should it ever occur.","The biggest job in grooming the Weimaraner is keeping the nails short. This is important for the comfort and health of your dog and cannot be overemphasized. When nail length gets out of hand, it's difficult to get it back to a proper length. (If you can hear a tap-tap-tap when they cross a hardwood floor, the nails are too long.) The short coat should be brushed to remove 'dead hair.' Don't forget to clean the ears clean the ears, since having an ear structure that impedes air-flow makes for the potential of infected ears.","Weimaraners have high exercise requirements. They need consistent exercise for their physical and mental well-being. They love a good run. While walking is OK, stretching their legs and getting ""up a full head of steam"" is far better. A tired Weimaraner is a good Weimaraner.","As one longtime breeder says, 'The good news is that Weimaraners are smart; the bad news is that Weimaraners are smart.' They learn quickly, and that includes both good and bad behaviors. Get to a training class and be consistent with your training methods. Weimaraners operate on the principle of 'What's in it for me?'

Standing between 17 and 19 inches at the shoulder, Welshies are described by their fans as being of 'handy size': bigger and stronger than Cocker Spaniels but smaller than English Springers.



 Welshies have two hallmarks that distinguish them from other spaniels: A uniquely tapered head and an eye-catching coat of bold red and white patterns. The beautiful coat isn't just ornamental'¿it's a waterproof, weatherproof, and thornproof suit that enables Welshies to show off their renowned versatility in all climates and on all terrains.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","To keep his attractive red-and-white coat looking its best, the Welsh Springer Spaniel needs at least weekly grooming. A good once-over with a soft brush should work well for this, along with a slicker brush or metal dog comb to work apart any mats or tangles that are starting to form. The nails should be trimmed every three to four weeks, and a bath every month or so with a gentle shampoo meant for dogs will help to keep the coat and skin clean and healthy.","Welsh Springer Spaniels are active, energetic dogs who are happiest when they have plenty of exercise as well as lots of time with their people. Play sessions with their family in a securely fenced yard or long daily walks with their owner work well. Interaction with their humans is the key to a happy Welshie. The breed is an excellent choice for those with an active lifestyle, as well as those looking for a loving family companion. Given the opportunity, these lovely spaniels will steal your heart.","The Welsh Springer tends to be ""reserved with strangers,"" to quote the breed standard. This should not be taken to mean a Welshie is timid or shy. Early socialization and puppy training classes are essential. Keep in mind that Welshies are hunting dogs, and the urge to chase birds and small mammals has been bred into them. Most puppies learn quickly to respect your pet cat or another dog, however.

Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as allergy problems, hip dysplasia and Legge-Calve-Perthes disease.","Care of the Welsh Terrier's coat is similar to that for other broken-coated terriers. The hair can be plucked by hand, commonly referred to as hand-stripping. This type of grooming is a continual process and an art that takes years to master. Pet grooming for a Welsh Terrier is not complicated. The dog should be clipped every 8 to 12 weeks, leaving the coat longer in cold weather. The nails should be trimmed at least weekly, and the dog brushed once or twice a week. Usually bathing between clippings is not necessary, but if it is, use a good shampoo that contains moisturizers.","Welsh Terriers are high-energy dogs. They enjoy getting exercise by doing activities with their owner such as playing ball or catching a flying disc in a fenced yard.

Beneath the plush-toy exterior, though, is a true working terrier of gameness and courage. Bred to hunt rats and other underground rodents, Westies are surprisingly strong and tough. The all-white double coat is hard to the touch, not soft and fluffy.



 Alert and active, Westies exhibit traits of a plucky and self-reliant ratting terrier: They require no pampering, they will chase after anything that moves, and their independence can make training a challenge.

Stripping (or plucking) the old, dead hair is the traditional way of taking care of the terrier coat, and it is the grooming method that must be used if you're interested in showing your dog. Pet owners often have their dogs' coats clipped for neatness. Most people find a professional groomer who will help keep that beautiful Westie look. Usually a visit to the groomer every 4 to 6 weeks will work just fine. Daily brushing and combing are important. Because the Westie has a hard coat, bathing too often can do more harm than good.","Westies love to romp and play, and they enjoy a nice walk. Since by nature they will run after anything that moves, the breed does best in a fenced area or on a leash. With their intelligence, energy, and can-do attitude, Westies excel in a variety of canine sports and activities, including obedience, rally, and agility. True to the breed's original purpose, they have the instinct to go to ground and are superstars at earthdog events.","Smart, confident, adaptable, and endlessly entertaining at play, the adorable Westie has charmed owners for more than 300 years. Like all terriers, Westies were bred to work alone. This terrier independence can make training a challenge, but thanks to their keen intelligence Westies take to patient, consistent lessons that are kept upbeat and interesting. Despite their size, Westies are sturdy, no-nonsense dogs who require little pampering."

","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Wetterhoun is a pretty healthy breed, even with its small population.  The NVSW currently has introduced an outcross program to help introduce more genetic variety into the breed.  There are recommended health tests from the parent club to reduce occurrences of health issues.","The Wetterhoun requires minimal grooming.  The coat is naturally oily and waterproof, therefore, frequent bathing is not necessary.",Daily exercise is good for the physical and mental well being of the Wetterhoun.,The Wetterhoun can be strong willed however they are never willfully disobedient.

He is an amiable, dignified, and gentle soul, but give him something to chase and he's all business. The name Whippet is synonymous with streamlined grace.
At somewhere between 18 and 22 inches at the shoulder, the Whippet looks like a Greyhound, but smaller. The Whippet exhibits the classic 'inverted S' lines of the sighthound. The deep chest and trim waist; a lean head supported by a long, arched neck; and slim but sturdy legs combine in a picture of an agile, fleet-footed athlete. Between bursts of intense pursuit, Whippets love to stretch out and relax for long hours, enjoying the role of a loving, and loved, companion. Whippets like a fenced yard to run in, but they do nicely in cozy apartments too'¿as long as they are exercised properly. Another plus for city dwellers: Whippets rarely bark. Despite the breed's elegant looks, the Whippet is a robust, low-maintenance dog.","Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
","The Whippet frame is not well suited to carrying excessive weight. While young Whippets may appear gangly and have difficulty keeping their ribs covered when they are in the period of rapid growth, a mature adult should not appear ribby but should have two to four visible vertebrae, and the hipbones should not appear sunk into dimples of fat. A Whippet at a healthy weight will likely appear 'skinny' to those accustomed to heavier-bodied, less fleet breeds, but maintaining your Whippet at the correct weight through lifelong portion control will extend his life and avoid many of the orthopedic problems that are both painful and expensive to repair. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as cardiac disease, deafness, and eye disorders.","The Whippet's short, smooth coat needs little maintenance beyond regular weekly grooming with a brush and the occasional bath. The ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the nails should be trimmed often if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.","Whippets are sprinters by nature, and adequate exercise could take the form of several vigorous retrieving sessions a week with ball or flying disc, regular walks, or play sessions with another dog in a safely fenced area. Always keep your Whippet on lead when not in a fenced area. Organized activities such as lure-coursing and agility also provide healthy outlets for the breed's energy and athleticism.","Whippets are calm in the house, preserving their energy for explosive bursts of running'¿ideally in a large, securely fenced area. Young Whippets are smart, agile, and mischievous, and they can jump and climb, so confining them safely while not under supervision is a must. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the dog grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."
