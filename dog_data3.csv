","Affenpinschers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as luxating patella, heart anomalies, vision problems, and hip dysplasia. Like other shorter-faced breeds, Affens can experience breathing problems during hot weather if they are permitted to overheat and then have difficulty panting in order to lower their body temperature, as dogs don't sweat to keep cool.","The Affenpinscher's medium-length, wiry coat should be groomed twice a week, first with a brush and then with a metal comb. Any mats should be pulled apart with the fingers. The hair on the head is usually brushed forward over the face, and then an inverted V-shape is cut to expose the eyes. Similarly, the hair on the bridge of the nose is trimmed into a fan shape to keep the eyes clear. The Affen's coat does not grow quickly, so a trimming a pet Affen every few months should suffice. The breed's national parent club, the Affenpinscher Club of America, provides a detailed grooming guide. Affens should also have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.","One of the attractions of the toy breeds is that their small size makes them ideal apartment dogs. While Affenpinschers can be perfectly happy living in close quarters, the breed is classified as 'moderately active,' and as such, they do need exercise. Indoor play, both with his owner and just between himself and a toy, can be enough to make up a large chunk of an Affen's exercise regimen. Even so, a brisk walk once or twice a day is required. In addition to providing exercise, these walks give the Affen a chance to socialize both with people and other dogs.","Affenpinschers are courageous, bold, and often feisty. Basic obedience training is recommended. The breed has an undeserved reputation as being difficult to train because Affenpinschers are independent minded and can be stubborn. The key is that they are very intelligent and generally eager to please the humans they have bonded with. Keep in mind that they are easily bored and tend to lose interest during long training sessions. Shorter, more frequent sessions with a trainer who has experience working with toy breeds are usually quite successful."

","Sighthounds such as Afghans have naturally low stores of body fat, so they tend to be sensitive to anesthesia; breed experts recommend seeking out a sighthound-savvy veterinarian for surgical procedures. Like other deep-chested types of dogs, Afghan Hounds can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur.","Afghan puppies have short, fuzzy coats (including adorable facial hair called 'monkey whiskers') that require little maintenance. They don't stay that way for long, however. As is to be expected, the long, silky coat of an adolescent or adult Afghan requires regular grooming. Several hours per week of brushing are needed to keep the hair free of tangles and mats, as well as to remove any debris. Keeping the hair clean and mat-free is the key to keeping the Afghan's glorious coat looking its best. Regular bathing, with shampoo and conditioner, is also required. Like all breeds, Afghans should have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.","Because Afghans are sighthounds, bred to hunt and chase prey by sight, they will have a strong instinct to run off in pursuit of perceived prey; walking off leash is not advisable. Short walks do not provide enough exercise for this athletic breed, and some owners take their leashed Afghans on long runs once they reach maturity. Ideally, an Afghan should have the opportunity to run full out several times a week in a large, enclosed area. Afghans are tall, lean, and strong, which makes them excellent jumpers, so their exercise area must have a high, secure fence.","Afghans are independent, dignified, and aloof in general, but they are affectionate and extremely loyal to humans they have bonded with. This loyalty can make it difficult for an adult Afghan to adjust to a new home. On the other hand, it can make them fairly easy to housetrain, because they want to please their owners. Unless obedience or agility competition is a goal, teaching basic commands such as come, sit, and stay is generally sufficient. Afghan Hound owners are often quick to point out that no amount of training will overcome the breed's hunting instinct to break off on a high-speed chase."
2,airedale-terrier,~23 inches,~50-70 pounds,11-14 years,3,3,3,1,3,1,Wiry,Short-Medium,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,3,62 of 1,Black & Tan-Grizzle & Tan,,"Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","Airedales are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will test for health concerns such as hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joint. An Airedale's ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and his teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Airedale has a short, wiry coat that needs relatively little maintenance. Weekly brushing keeps the coat looking good and has the additional advantage of removing dead hair that would otherwise be shed around the house. (Some people with dog allergies have found that they can share a living space with a well-brushed Airedale without suffering any symptoms.) If the weekly session turns up any mats, they should be broken up with the fingers and then teased apart with a comb. Full grooming '¿ where the dog is bathed, brushed, and stripped or clipped '¿ should be done three or four times a year, either by the owner or a professional groomer.","Terriers are generally known for their high energy levels. Given that the Airedale is the largest of all terriers, that energy must be channeled into safe outlets. Fortunately, Airedales love to play with other family members. A daily play session of moderate length, in addition to walks (or backyard time) several times a day, should be enough to satisfy the Airedale's exercise requirements. Airedales play well with children, but interactions with toddlers and smaller children should be closely supervised. Airedales are rangy but strong; that strength, combined with a boisterous personality, can lead to mishaps.","Because of the Airedale's size (he is a medium-sized dog, but the largest of the terrier breeds), strength, and rambunctiousness, obedience training is highly recommended. At a minimum, an Airedale should learn basic obedience commands such as come, sit, and stay. The breed's intelligence and the fact that they bond closely with family members can make training easy. Owners and trainers should keep in mind that an intelligent dog is an easily bored dog, so varied training sessions will be more successful than repetitive ones. Also, an easily bored dog who is often left alone for long periods of time will tend to develop undesirable behaviors. It often helps to provide the dog with challenging toys that will keep him happily occupied."

","Like many dogs, Akitas can experience bloat, a sudden, life-threatening condition where the stomach can twist without veterinary intervention. Bloat is a medical emergency, and Akita owners should learn to recognize the signs. Prospective owners should be sure to work with a reputable breeder who tests his or her breeding stock for health concerns such as eye and thyroid disorders, and hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joints that can cause pain and arthritis.","Akitas tend to be clean and have little 'doggy odor.' They don't require extensive grooming, but their thick, luxurious double coat should be brushed at least once a week to look its best. Although Akitas shed only minimally most of the time, expect their dense undercoat to 'blow' twice a year, where it will shed so profusely that it comes out in clumps all over your house. During this time it helps to brush the dog more frequently to get rid of the dead coat. The nails should also be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause pain and problems for the dog. Remember also to brush the dog's teeth often to ensure dental health.","The Akita is generally not a highly active breed but does require moderate exercise. A jog or brisk walk around the block at least once a day can meet the needs of most individuals of the breed. Akitas also enjoy playing energetically. Although they are large dogs '¿ males often weigh more than 100 pounds '¿ with sufficient daily exercise Akitas can do well in a relatively small home. They are hardy dogs bred to withstand the harsh outdoor conditions of northern Japan, but they were bred as housedogs and guardians as well as hunters, and adapt very well to life in the home.","Akitas are very intelligent and loyal but also have an independent, headstrong nature. As large and very powerful dogs, it is vital that they are trained consistently,  beginning in puppyhood. They are instinctive guardians, so it's especially important that Akitas have early and extensive socialization when young. They must learn to accept a wide variety of strangers and not perceive them as a threat. Because of their independence and strong prey drive, they should never be off lead in an unsecured area. Akitas tend to be aggressive toward other dogs, particularly of the same sex, and extreme caution should be used in canine interactions."

","The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is a generally healthy breed.  Responsible breeders screen breeding stock for health conditions including patellar luxation, autoimmune thyroiditis, heart murmur, eye disorders, and Factor VII deficiency.  Prospective AKK owners are  encouraged to purchase from responsible/reputable breeders who are doing these  evaluations, and confirm the health screening of the sire and dam.  Responsible breeders use the many tools available, along with the knowledge of their dogs¿ pedigrees, to  selectively choose breeding dogs in order to reduce the likelihood of temperament,  structure and health concerns.    ","The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is a double coated breed, with a short dense undercoat and a longer outer coat of guard hairs. This coat not only helps insulate them from the cold and heat, it also helps protect the skin from the sun. While the undercoat is shed (or blown) twice a year, some owners quip that it lasts for six months at a time. Weekly brushings and/or combing help keep the coat and skin in good condition, and help reduce the hair around the house.  AKK often need only a few baths a year as their coats tend to naturally repel dirt, and they do not have the ¿dog odor¿ that many breeds have. Blowing the dog with a strong cool blow-dryer is also a good way to remove loose hair and dirt. Avoid using any tools with blades. The nails should be trimmed regularly to prevent any foot problems.  Alaskan Klee Kai competing in conformation require a bit more selective grooming or bathing for the best presentation. The breed standard is specific: ""The Alaskan Klee Kai is shown in its natural state and the only trimming permissible is around the foot area to present a clean/neat appearance. Any trimming of the whiskers, or the fur on any other part of the dog, is to be severely penalized.""","The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is an active dog with a medium-high energy level. Regular exercise and doing activities together, both physically and mentally, strengthens the bond between dog and owner, and helps to avoid potential destructive behavior. AKK enjoy doing performance sports or exploring life with their people in many activities such as camping, hiking, climbing, swimming, boating, kayaking, and even on paddle boards! For those who live in a more urban setting, or have a more sedate lifestyle, daily walks or a game of fetch can also provide great exercise. Alaskan Klee Kai are foremost loving companion dogs who form strong bonds with their family and are as happy playfully interacting with their owners exploring the outdoors as they are relaxing lovingly on the laps of their youthful or elderly owners. Like many dog breeds, Alaskan Klee Kai are curious, clever, fast and sneaky, and may have a high prey drive, so it is important to keep the dog on a leash or in a securely fenced yard (or secured area) at all times when outside of the home. AKK are not suitable for people who cannot spend time with their dogs","The Alaskan Klee Kai are a perceptive breed that enjoys being physically and mentally challenged. They love learning new things, and have an energetic eagerness to participate in a broad array of activities which make them well suited for multiple performance sports such as Agility, Racing, Obedience, Rally, Scent Work, Weight Pull, Dock Diving, and Carting. They are also used in therapy work, service work, diabetic and gluten detection, as well as emotional support dogs. AKK have a sensitive, reserved and cautious nature. A gentle hand, positive reinforcement, proper early socialization and training throughout their lives is very beneficial."
